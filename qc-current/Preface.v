(** * Setup *)

(** For working with this material, you will need to install
    QuickChick. For this version, we are going to be using a 
    beta release of QuickChick-2.0 that you will need to build 
    from source. It is available here:

       {https://github.com/QuickChick/QuickChick/releases/tag/v.2.0+beta.16}

    The [QuickChickInterface] chapter serves as a reference
    manual for QuickChick.  The rest of the book explains its features
    more gently. *)
