(** * Preface *)

(** This volume of _Software Foundations_ introduces QuickChick, a
    property-based random testing tool for Coq. *)

(** * Setup *)

(** For working with this material, you will need to install
    QuickChick. For this version, we are going to be using a
    QuickChick-2.0, which can be installed by simply running:

    [ opam install coq-quickchick ]

    The [QuickChickInterface] chapter serves as a reference
    manual for QuickChick.  The rest of the book explains its features
    more gently. *)
