(** * Stlc: The Simply Typed Lambda-Calculus *)

(** The simply typed lambda-calculus (STLC) is a tiny core
    calculus embodying the key concept of _functional abstraction_,
    which shows up in pretty much every real-world programming
    language in some form (functions, procedures, methods, etc.).

    We will follow exactly the same pattern as in the previous chapter
    when formalizing this calculus (syntax, small-step semantics,
    typing rules) and its main properties (progress and preservation).
    The new technical challenges arise from the mechanisms of
    _variable binding_ and _substitution_.  It will take some work to
    deal with these. *)

(** * Overview *)

(** The STLC is built on some collection of _base types_:
    booleans, numbers, strings, etc.  The exact choice of base types
    doesn't matter much -- the construction of the language and its
    theoretical properties work out the same no matter what we
    choose -- so for the sake of brevity let's take just [Bool] for
    the moment.  At the end of the chapter we'll see how to add more
    base types, and in later chapters we'll enrich the pure STLC with
    other useful constructs like pairs, records, subtyping, and
    mutable state.

    Starting from boolean constants and conditionals, we add three
    things:
        - variables
        - function abstractions
        - application

    This gives us the following collection of abstract syntax
    constructors (written out first in informal BNF notation -- we'll
    formalize it below).

       t ::= x                         variable
           | \x:T.t                    abstraction
           | t t                       application
           | tru                       constant true
           | fls                       constant false
           | test t then t else t      conditional
*)

(** The [\] symbol in a function abstraction [\x:T.t] is generally
    written as a Greek letter "lambda" (hence the name of the
    calculus).  The variable [x] is called the _parameter_ to the
    function; the term [t] is its _body_.  The annotation [:T]
    specifies the type of arguments that the function can be applied
    to. *)

(** Some examples:

      - [\x:Bool. x]

        The identity function for booleans.

      - [(\x:Bool. x) tru]

        The identity function for booleans, applied to the boolean [tru].

      - [\x:Bool. test x then fls else tru]

        The boolean "not" function.

      - [\x:Bool. tru]

        The constant function that takes every (boolean) argument to
        [tru].
      - [\x:Bool. \y:Bool. x]

        A two-argument function that takes two booleans and returns
        the first one.  (As in Coq, a two-argument function is really
        a one-argument function whose body is also a one-argument
        function.)

      - [(\x:Bool. \y:Bool. x) fls tru]

        A two-argument function that takes two booleans and returns
        the first one, applied to the booleans [fls] and [tru].

        As in Coq, application associates to the left -- i.e., this
        expression is parsed as [((\x:Bool. \y:Bool. x) fls) tru].

      - [\f:Bool->Bool. f (f tru)]

        A higher-order function that takes a _function_ [f] (from
        booleans to booleans) as an argument, applies [f] to [tru],
        and applies [f] again to the result.

      - [(\f:Bool->Bool. f (f tru)) (\x:Bool. fls)]

        The same higher-order function, applied to the constantly
        [fls] function. *)

(** As the last several examples show, the STLC is a language of
    _higher-order_ functions: we can write down functions that take
    other functions as arguments and/or return other functions as
    results.

    The STLC doesn't provide any primitive syntax for defining _named_
    functions -- all functions are "anonymous."  We'll see in chapter
    [MoreStlc] that it is easy to add named functions to what we've
    got -- indeed, the fundamental naming and binding mechanisms are
    exactly the same.

    The _types_ of the STLC include [Bool], which classifies the
    boolean constants [tru] and [fls] as well as more complex
    computations that yield booleans, plus _arrow types_ that classify
    functions.

      T ::= Bool
          | T -> T

    For example:

      - [\x:Bool. fls] has type [Bool->Bool]

      - [\x:Bool. x] has type [Bool->Bool]

      - [(\x:Bool. x) tru] has type [Bool]

      - [\x:Bool. \y:Bool. x] has type [Bool->Bool->Bool]
                              (i.e., [Bool -> (Bool->Bool)])

      - [(\x:Bool. \y:Bool. x) fls] has type [Bool->Bool]

      - [(\x:Bool. \y:Bool. x) fls tru] has type [Bool] *)

(** * Syntax *)

(** We next formalize the syntax of the STLC. *)

Module STLC.

(** ** Types *)

Inductive ty : Type :=
  | Bool  : ty
  | Arrow : ty -> ty -> ty.

(** ** Terms *)

  | var : string -> tm
  | app : tm -> tm -> tm
  | abs : string -> ty -> tm -> tm
  | tru : tm
  | fls : tm
  | test : tm -> tm -> tm -> tm.

(** Note that an abstraction [\x:T.t] (formally, [abs x T t]) is
    always annotated with the type [T] of its parameter, in contrast
    to Coq (and other functional languages like ML, Haskell, etc.),
    which use type inference to fill in missing annotations.  We're
    not considering type inference here. *)

    (var x)).

(** [k = \x:Bool. \y:Bool. x] *)

Notation k := (abs x Bool (abs y Bool (var x))).

(** [notB = \x:Bool. test x then fls else tru] *)

Notation notB := (abs x Bool (test (var x) fls tru)).

(** (We write these as [Notation]s rather than [Definition]s to make
    things easier for [auto].) *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Operational Semantics *)

(** To define the small-step semantics of STLC terms, we begin,
    as always, by defining the set of values.  Next, we define the
    critical notions of _free variables_ and _substitution_, which are
    used in the reduction rule for application expressions.  And
    finally we give the small-step relation itself. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Values *)

(** To define the values of the STLC, we have a few cases to consider.

    First, for the boolean part of the language, the situation is
    clear: [tru] and [fls] are the only values.  A [test] expression
    is never a value. *)

(** Second, an application is not a value: it represents a function
    being invoked on some argument, which clearly still has work left
    to do. *)

(** Third, for abstractions, we have a choice:

      - We can say that [\x:T. t] is a value only when [t] is a
        value -- i.e., only if the function's body has been
        reduced (as much as it can be without knowing what argument it
        is going to be applied to).

      - Or we can say that [\x:T. t] is always a value, no matter
        whether [t] is one or not -- in other words, we can say that
        reduction stops at abstractions.

    Our usual way of evaluating expressions in Coq makes the first
    choice -- for example,

         Compute (fun x:bool => 3 + 4)

    yields:

          fun x:bool => 7

    Most real-world functional programming languages make the second
    choice -- reduction of a function's body only begins when the
    function is actually applied to an argument.  We also make the
    second choice here. *)

Inductive value : tm -> Prop :=
  | v_abs : forall x T t,
      value (abs x T t)
  | v_tru :
      value tru
  | v_fls :
      value fls.

Hint Constructors value.

(** Finally, we must consider what constitutes a _complete_ program.

    Intuitively, a "complete program" must not refer to any undefined
    variables.  We'll see shortly how to define the _free_ variables
    in a STLC term.  A complete program is _closed_ -- that is, it
    contains no free variables.

    (Conversely, a term with free variables is often called an _open
    term_.) *)

(** Having made the choice not to reduce under abstractions, we don't
    need to worry about whether variables are values, since we'll
    always be reducing programs "from the outside in," and that means
    the [step] relation will always be working with closed terms.  *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Substitution *)

(** Now we come to the heart of the STLC: the operation of
    substituting one term for a variable in another term.  This
    operation is used below to define the operational semantics of
    function application, where we will need to substitute the
    argument term for the function parameter in the function's body.
    For example, we reduce

       (\x:Bool. test x then tru else x) fls

    to

       test fls then tru else fls

    by substituting [fls] for the parameter [x] in the body of the
    function.

    In general, we need to be able to substitute some given term [s]
    for occurrences of some variable [x] in another term [t].  In
    informal discussions, this is usually written [ [x:=s]t ] and
    pronounced "substitute [s] for [x] in [t]." *)

(** Here are some examples:

      - [[x:=tru] (test x then x else fls)]
           yields [test tru then tru else fls]

      - [[x:=tru] x] yields [tru]

      - [[x:=tru] (test x then x else y)] yields [test tru then tru else y]

      - [[x:=tru] y] yields [y]

      - [[x:=tru] fls] yields [fls] (vacuous substitution)

      - [[x:=tru] (\y:Bool. test y then x else fls)]
           yields [\y:Bool. test y then tru else fls]

      - [[x:=tru] (\y:Bool. x)] yields [\y:Bool. tru]

      - [[x:=tru] (\y:Bool. y)] yields [\y:Bool. y]

      - [[x:=tru] (\x:Bool. x)] yields [\x:Bool. x]

    The last example is very important: substituting [x] with [tru] in
    [\x:Bool. x] does _not_ yield [\x:Bool. tru]!  The reason for
    this is that the [x] in the body of [\x:Bool. x] is _bound_ by the
    abstraction: it is a new, local name that just happens to be
    spelled the same as some global name [x]. *)

(** Here is the definition, informally...

       [x:=s]x               = s
       [x:=s]y               = y                     if x <> y
       [x:=s](\x:T11. t12)   = \x:T11. t12
       [x:=s](\y:T11. t12)   = \y:T11. [x:=s]t12     if x <> y
       [x:=s](t1 t2)         = ([x:=s]t1) ([x:=s]t2)
       [x:=s]tru             = tru
       [x:=s]fls             = fls
       [x:=s](test t1 then t2 else t3) =
              test [x:=s]t1 then [x:=s]t2 else [x:=s]t3
*)

(** ... and formally: *)

Reserved Notation "'[' x ':=' s ']' t" (at level 20).

Fixpoint subst (x : string) (s : tm) (t : tm) : tm :=
  match t with
  | var x' =>
      if eqb_string x x' then s else t
  | abs x' T t1 =>
      abs x' T (if eqb_string x x' then t1 else ([x:=s] t1))
  | app t1 t2 =>
      app ([x:=s] t1) ([x:=s] t2)
  | tru =>
      tru
  | fls =>
      fls
  | test t1 t2 t3 =>
      test ([x:=s] t1) ([x:=s] t2) ([x:=s] t3)
  end

where "'[' x ':=' s ']' t" := (subst x s t).

(** _Technical note_: Substitution becomes trickier to define if we
    consider the case where [s], the term being substituted for a
    variable in some other term, may itself contain free variables.
    Since we are only interested here in defining the [step] relation
    on _closed_ terms (i.e., terms like [\x:Bool. x] that include
    binders for all of the variables they mention), we can sidestep this
    extra complexity, but it must be dealt with when formalizing
    richer languages. *)

(** For example, using the definition of substitution above to
    substitute the _open_ term [s = \x:Bool. r], where [r] is a _free_
    reference to some global resource, for the variable [z] in the
    term [t = \r:Bool. z], where [r] is a bound variable, we would get
    [\r:Bool. \x:Bool. r], where the free reference to [r] in [s] has
    been "captured" by the binder at the beginning of [t].

    Why would this be bad?  Because it violates the principle that the
    names of bound variables do not matter.  For example, if we rename
    the bound variable in [t], e.g., let [t' = \w:Bool. z], then
    [[x:=s]t'] is [\w:Bool. \x:Bool. r], which does not behave the
    same as [[x:=s]t = \r:Bool. \x:Bool. r].  That is, renaming a
    bound variable changes how [t] behaves under substitution. *)

(** See, for example, [Aydemir 2008] (in Bib.v) for further discussion
    of this issue. *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (substi_correct) 

    The definition that we gave above uses Coq's [Fixpoint] facility
    to define substitution as a _function_.  Suppose, instead, we
    wanted to define substitution as an inductive _relation_ [substi].
    We've begun the definition by providing the [Inductive] header and
    one of the constructors; your job is to fill in the rest of the
    constructors and prove that the relation you've defined coincides
    with the function given above. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Reduction *)

(** The small-step reduction relation for STLC now follows the
    same pattern as the ones we have seen before.  Intuitively, to
    reduce a function application, we first reduce its left-hand
    side (the function) until it becomes an abstraction; then we
    reduce its right-hand side (the argument) until it is also a
    value; and finally we substitute the argument for the bound
    variable in the body of the abstraction.  This last rule, written
    informally as

      (\x:T.t12) v2 --> [x:=v2]t12

    is traditionally called _beta-reduction_. *)

(** Next we consider the typing relation of the STLC. *)

(** _Question_: What is the type of the term "[x y]"?

    _Answer_: It depends on the types of [x] and [y]!

    I.e., in order to assign a type to a term, we need to know
    what assumptions we should make about the types of its free
    variables.

    This leads us to a three-place _typing judgment_, informally
    written [Gamma |- t \in T], where [Gamma] is a
    "typing context" -- a mapping from variables to their types. *)

Example typing_example_1 :
  empty |- abs x Bool (var x) \in Arrow Bool Bool.
Proof.
  apply T_Abs. apply T_Var. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Note that, since we added the [has_type] constructors to the hints
    database, [auto] can actually solve this one immediately. *)

Example typing_example_1' :
  empty |- abs x Bool (var x) \in Arrow Bool Bool.
Proof. auto.  Qed.

(** More examples:

       empty |- \x:A. \y:A->A. y (y x)
             \in A -> (A->A) -> A.
*)

Example typing_example_2 :
  empty |-
    (abs x Bool
       (abs y (Arrow Bool Bool)
          (app (var y) (app (var y) (var x))))) \in
    (Arrow Bool (Arrow (Arrow Bool Bool) Bool)).
Proof with auto using update_eq.

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, optional (typing_example_2_full) 

    Prove the same result without using [auto], [eauto], or
    [eapply] (or [...]). *)

Example typing_example_2_full :
  empty |-
    (abs x Bool
       (abs y (Arrow Bool Bool)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard (typing_example_3) 

    Formally prove the following typing derivation holds:

    
       empty |- \x:Bool->B. \y:Bool->Bool. \z:Bool.
                   y (x z)
             \in T.
*)

Example typing_example_3 :
  exists T,
    empty |-
      (abs x (Arrow Bool Bool)
         (abs y (Arrow Bool Bool)
            (abs z Bool
               (app (var y) (app (var x) (var z)))))) \in
      T.
Proof with auto.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** We can also show that some terms are _not_ typable.  For example, 
    let's check that there is no typing derivation assigning a type
    to the term [\x:Bool. \y:Bool, x y] -- i.e.,

    ~ exists T,
        empty |- \x:Bool. \y:Bool, x y \in T.
*)

Example typing_nonexample_1 :
  ~ exists T,
      empty |-
        (abs x Bool
            (abs y Bool
               (app (var x) (var y)))) \in
        T.
Proof.
  intros Hc. destruct Hc as [T Hc].
  (* The [clear] tactic is useful here for tidying away bits of
     the context that we're not going to need again. *)
  inversion Hc; subst; clear Hc.

  inversion H5; subst; clear H5 H4.
  inversion H2; subst; clear H2.

    Another nonexample:

        empty |-
