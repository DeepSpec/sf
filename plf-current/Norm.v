(* Chapter written and maintained by Andrew Tolmach *)

(** This optional chapter is based on chapter 12 of _Types and
    Programming Languages_ (Pierce).  It may be useful to look at the
    two together, as that chapter includes explanations and informal
    proofs that are not repeated here.

    In this chapter, we consider another fundamental theoretical
    property of the simply typed lambda-calculus: the fact that the
    evaluation of a well-typed program is guaranteed to halt in a
    finite number of steps---i.e., every well-typed term is
    _normalizable_.

    Unlike the type-safety properties we have considered so far, the
    normalization property does not extend to full-blown programming
    languages, because these languages nearly always extend the simply
    typed lambda-calculus with constructs, such as general
    recursion (see the [MoreStlc] chapter) or recursive types, that
    can be used to write nonterminating programs.  However, the issue
    of normalization reappears at the level of _types_ when we
    consider the metatheory of polymorphic versions of the lambda
    calculus such as System F-omega: in this system, the language of
    types effectively contains a copy of the simply typed
    lambda-calculus, and the termination of the typechecking algorithm
    will hinge on the fact that a "normalization" operation on type
    expressions is guaranteed to terminate.

    Another reason for studying normalization proofs is that they are
    some of the most beautiful---and mind-blowing---mathematics to be
    found in the type theory literature, often (as here) involving the
    fundamental proof technique of _logical relations_.

    The calculus we shall consider here is the simply typed
    lambda-calculus over a single base type [bool] and with
    pairs. We'll give most details of the development for the basic
    lambda-calculus terms treating [bool] as an uninterpreted base
    type, and leave the extension to the boolean operators and pairs
    to the reader.  Even for the base calculus, normalization is not
    entirely trivial to prove, since each reduction of a term can
    duplicate redexes in subterms. *)

(** * Normalization *)

(** Now for the actual normalization proof.

    Our goal is to prove that every well-typed term reduces to a
    normal form.  In fact, it turns out to be convenient to prove
    something slightly stronger, namely that every well-typed term
    reduces to a _value_.  This follows from the weaker property
    anyway via Progress (why?) but otherwise we don't need Progress,
    and we didn't bother re-proving it above.

    Here's the key definition: *)

Definition halts  (t:tm) : Prop :=  exists t', t -->* t' /\  value t'.

(** A trivial fact: *)

Lemma value_halts : forall v, value v -> halts v.
Proof.
  intros v H. unfold halts.
  exists v. split.
  apply multi_refl.
  assumption.
Qed.

(** The key issue in the normalization proof (as in many proofs by
    induction) is finding a strong enough induction hypothesis.  To
    this end, we begin by defining, for each type [T], a set [R_T] of
    closed terms of type [T].  We will specify these sets using a
    relation [R] and write [R T t] when [t] is in [R_T]. (The sets
    [R_T] are sometimes called _saturated sets_ or _reducibility
    candidates_.)

    Here is the definition of [R] for the base language:

    - [R bool t] iff [t] is a closed term of type [bool] and [t] halts
      in a value

    - [R (T1 -> T2) t] iff [t] is a closed term of type [T1 -> T2] and
      [t] halts in a value _and_ for any term [s] such that [R T1 s],
      we have [R T2 (t s)]. *)

(** This definition gives us the strengthened induction hypothesis that we
    need.  Our primary goal is to show that all _programs_ ---i.e., all
    closed terms of base type---halt.  But closed terms of base type can
    contain subterms of functional type, so we need to know something
    about these as well.  Moreover, it is not enough to know that these
    subterms halt, because the application of a normalized function to a
    normalized argument involves a substitution, which may enable more
    reduction steps.  So we need a stronger condition for terms of
    functional type: not only should they halt themselves, but, when
    applied to halting arguments, they should yield halting results.

    The form of [R] is characteristic of the _logical relations_ proof
    technique.  (Since we are just dealing with unary relations here, we
    could perhaps more properly say _logical properties_.)  If we want to
    prove some property [P] of all closed terms of type [A], we proceed by
    proving, by induction on types, that all terms of type [A] _possess_
    property [P], all terms of type [A->A] _preserve_ property [P], all
    terms of type [(A->A)->(A->A)] _preserve the property of preserving_
    property [P], and so on.  We do this by defining a family of
    properties, indexed by types.  For the base type [A], the property is
    just [P].  For functional types, it says that the function should map
    values satisfying the property at the input type to values satisfying
    the property at the output type.

    When we come to formalize the definition of [R] in Coq, we hit a
    problem.  The most obvious formulation would be as a parameterized
    Inductive proposition like this:

      Inductive R : ty -> tm -> Prop :=
      | R_bool : forall b t, has_type empty t Bool ->

                      R Bool t

                      R (Arrow T1 T2) t.

    Unfortunately, Coq rejects this definition because it violates the
    _strict positivity requirement_ for inductive definitions, which says
    that the type being defined must not occur to the left of an arrow in
    the type of a constructor argument. Here, it is the third argument to
    [R_arrow], namely [(forall s, R T1 s -> R TS (app t s))], and
    specifically the [R T1 s] part, that violates this rule.  (The
    outermost arrows separating the constructor arguments don't count when
    applying this rule; otherwise we could never have genuinely inductive
    properties at all!)  The reason for the rule is that types defined
    with non-positive recursion can be used to build non-terminating
    functions, which as we know would be a disaster for Coq's logical
    soundness. Even though the relation we want in this case might be
    perfectly innocent, Coq still rejects it because it fails the
    positivity test.

    Fortunately, it turns out that we _can_ define [R] using a
    [Fixpoint]: *)

Fixpoint R (T:ty) (t:tm) {struct T} : Prop :=
  has_type empty t T /\ halts t /\
  (match T with
   | Bool  => True
   | Arrow T1 T2 => (forall s, R T1 s -> R T2 (app t s))

   (* ... edit the next line when dealing with products *)
   | Prod T1 T2 => False    (* FILL IN HERE *)
   end).

(** As immediate consequences of this definition, we have that every
    element of every set [R_T] halts in a value and is closed with type
    [t] :*)

Lemma R_typable_empty : forall {T} {t}, R T t -> has_type empty t T.
Proof.
  intros. destruct T; unfold R in H; inversion H; inversion H1; assumption.
Qed.

(** Now we proceed to show the main result, which is that every
    well-typed term of type [T] is an element of [R_T].  Together with
    [R_halts], that will show that every well-typed term halts in a
    value.  *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** **  Membership in [R_T] Is Invariant Under Reduction *)

(** We start with a preliminary lemma that shows a kind of strong
    preservation property, namely that membership in [R_T] is _invariant_
    under reduction. We will need this property in both directions,
    i.e., both to show that a term in [R_T] stays in [R_T] when it takes a
    forward step, and to show that any term that ends up in [R_T] after a
    step must have been in [R_T] to begin with.

    First of all, an easy preliminary lemma. Note that in the forward
    direction the proof depends on the fact that our language is
    determinstic. This lemma might still be true for nondeterministic
    languages, but the proof would be harder! *)

(** Now the main lemma, which comes in two parts, one for each

    structure of types.

    One requirement for staying in [R_T] is to stay in type [T]. In the
    forward direction, we get this from ordinary type Preservation. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Closed Instances of Terms of Type [t] Belong to [R_T] *)

(** Now we proceed to show that every term of type [T] belongs to
    [R_T].  Here, the induction will be on typing derivations (it would be
    surprising to see a proof about well-typed terms that did not
    somewhere involve induction on typing derivations!).  The only
    technical difficulty here is in dealing with the abstraction case.
    Since we are arguing by induction, the demonstration that a term
    [abs x T1 t2] belongs to [R_(T1->T2)] should involve applying the
    induction hypothesis to show that [t2] belongs to [R_(T2)].  But
    [R_(T2)] is defined to be a set of _closed_ terms, while [t2] may
    contain [x] free, so this does not make sense.

    This problem is resolved by using a standard trick to suitably
    generalize the induction hypothesis: instead of proving a statement
    involving a closed term, we generalize it to cover all closed
    _instances_ of an open term [t].  Informally, the statement of the
    lemma will look like this:

    If [x1:T1,..xn:Tn |- t : T] and [v1,...,vn] are values such that
    [R T1 v1], [R T2 v2], ..., [R Tn vn], then
    [R T ([x1:=v1][x2:=v2]...[xn:=vn]t)].

    The proof will proceed by induction on the typing derivation
    [x1:T1,..xn:Tn |- t : T]; the most interesting case will be the one
    for abstraction. *)

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Multisubstitutions, Multi-Extensions, and Instantiations *)

(** However, before we can proceed to formalize the statement and
    proof of the lemma, we'll need to build some (rather tedious)
    machinery to deal with the fact that we are performing _multiple_
    substitutions on term [t] and _multiple_ extensions of the typing
    context.  In particular, we must be precise about the order in which
    the substitutions occur and how they act on each other.  Often these
    details are simply elided in informal paper proofs, but of course Coq
    won't let us do that. Since here we are substituting closed terms, we
    don't need to worry about how one substitution might affect the term
    put in place by another.  But we still do need to worry about the
    _order_ of substitutions, because it is quite possible for the same
    identifier to appear multiple times among the [x1,...xn] with
    different associated [vi] and [Ti].

    To make everything precise, we will assume that environments are
    extended from left to right, and multiple substitutions are performed
    from right to left.  To see that this is consistent, suppose we have
    an environment written as [...,y:bool,...,y:nat,...]  and a
    corresponding term substitution written as [...[y:=(tbool
    true)]...[y:=(const 3)]...t].  Since environments are extended from
    left to right, the binding [y:nat] hides the binding [y:bool]; since
    substitutions are performed right to left, we do the substitution
    [y:=(const 3)] first, so that the substitution [y:=(tbool true)] has
    no effect. Substitution thus correctly preserves the type of the term.

    With these points in mind, the following definitions should make sense.

    A _multisubstitution_ is the result of applying a list of
    substitutions, which we call an _environment_. *)

Definition env := list (string * tm).

Fixpoint msubst (ss:env) (t:tm) {struct ss} : tm :=
match ss with
| nil => t
| ((x,s)::ss') => msubst ss' ([x:=s]t)
end.

(** We need similar machinery to talk about repeated extension of a
    typing context using a list of (identifier, type) pairs, which we
    call a _type assignment_. *)

Definition tass := list (string * ty).

Fixpoint mupdate (Gamma : context) (xts : tass) :=
  match xts with
  | nil => Gamma
  | ((x,v)::xts') => update (mupdate Gamma xts') x v
  end.

(** We will need some simple operations that work uniformly on
    environments and type assigments *)

Fixpoint lookup {X:Set} (k : string) (l : list (string * X)) {struct l}
              : option X :=
  match l with
    | nil => None
    | (j,x) :: l' =>
      if eqb_string j k then Some x else lookup k l'
  end.

Fixpoint drop {X:Set} (n:string) (nxs:list (string * X)) {struct nxs}
            : list (string * X) :=
  match nxs with
    | nil => nil
    | ((n',x)::nxs') =>
        if eqb_string n' n then drop n nxs'
        else (n',x)::(drop n nxs')
  end.

(** An _instantiation_ combines a type assignment and a value
    environment with the same domains, where corresponding elements are
    in R. *)

Inductive instantiation :  tass -> env -> Prop :=
| V_nil :
    instantiation nil nil
| V_cons : forall x T v c e,
    value v -> R T v ->
    instantiation c e ->
    instantiation ((x,T)::c) ((x,v)::e).
