    theorem. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Canonical Forms *)

(** As we saw for the simple calculus in the [Types] chapter, the
    first step in establishing basic properties of reduction and types
    is to identify the possible _canonical forms_ (i.e., well-typed
    closed values) belonging to each type.  For [Bool], these are the
    boolean values [tru] and [fls]; for arrow types, they are
    lambda-abstractions.  *)

(** * Progress *)

(** The _progress_ theorem tells us that closed, well-typed
    terms are not stuck: either a well-typed term is a value, or it
    can take a reduction step.  The proof is a relatively
    straightforward extension of the progress proof we saw in the
    [Types] chapter.  We give the proof in English first, then
    the formal version. *)

Theorem progress : forall t T,
  empty |- t \in T ->
  value t \/ exists t', t --> t'.

(** _Proof_: By induction on the derivation of [|- t \in T].

    - The last rule of the derivation cannot be [T_Var], since a
      variable is never well typed in an empty context.

    - The [T_Tru], [T_Fls], and [T_Abs] cases are trivial, since in
      each of these cases we can see by inspecting the rule that [t]
      is a value.

    - If the last rule of the derivation is [T_App], then [t] has the
      form [t1 t2] for some [t1] and [t2], where [|- t1 \in T2 -> T]
      and [|- t2 \in T2] for some type [T2].  The induction hypothesis
      for the first subderivation says that either [t1] is a value or
      else it can take a reduction step.

        - If [t1] is a value, then consider [t2], which by the
          induction hypothesis for the second subderivation must also
          either be a value or take a step.

            - Suppose [t2] is a value.  Since [t1] is a value with an
              arrow type, it must be a lambda abstraction; hence [t1
              t2] can take a step by [ST_AppAbs].

            - Otherwise, [t2] can take a step, and hence so can [t1
              t2] by [ST_App2].

        - If [t1] can take a step, then so can [t1 t2] by [ST_App1].

    - If the last rule of the derivation is [T_Test], then [t = test
      t1 then t2 else t3], where [t1] has type [Bool].  The first IH
      says that [t1] either is a value or takes a step.

        - If [t1] is a value, then since it has type [Bool] it must be
          either [tru] or [fls].  If it is [tru], then [t] steps to
          [t2]; otherwise it steps to [t3].

        - Otherwise, [t1] takes a step, and therefore so does [t] (by
          [ST_Test]). *)

(** * Preservation *)

(** The other half of the type soundness property is the
    preservation of types during reduction.  For this part, we'll need
    to develop some technical machinery for reasoning about variables
    and substitution.  Working from top to bottom (from the high-level
    property we are actually interested in to the lowest-level
    technical lemmas that are needed by various cases of the more
    interesting proofs), the story goes like this:

      - The _preservation theorem_ is proved by induction on a typing
        derivation, pretty much as we did in the [Types] chapter.
        The one case that is significantly different is the one for
        the [ST_AppAbs] rule, whose definition uses the substitution
        operation.  To see that this step preserves typing, we need to
        know that the substitution itself does.  So we prove a...

      - _substitution lemma_, stating that substituting a (closed)
        term [s] for a variable [x] in a term [t] preserves the type
        of [t].  The proof goes by induction on the form of [t] and
        requires looking at all the different cases in the definition
        of substitition.  This time, the tricky cases are the ones for
        variables and for function abstractions.  In both, we discover
        that we need to take a term [s] that has been shown to be
        well-typed in some context [Gamma] and consider the same term
        [s] in a slightly different context [Gamma'].  For this we
        prove a...

      - _context invariance_ lemma, showing that typing is preserved
        under "inessential changes" to the context [Gamma] -- in
        particular, changes that do not affect any of the free
        variables of the term.  And finally, for this, we need a
        careful definition of...

      - the _free variables_ in a term -- i.e., variables that are
        used in the term in positions that are _not_ in the scope of
        an enclosing function abstraction binding a variable of the
        same name.

   To make Coq happy, of course, we need to formalize the story in the
   opposite order... *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Free Occurrences *)

(** A variable [x] _appears free in_ a term _t_ if [t] contains some
    occurrence of [x] that is not under an abstraction labeled [x].
    For example:
      - [y] appears free, but [x] does not, in [\x:T->U. x y]
      - both [x] and [y] appear free in [(\x:T->U. x y) x]
      - no variables appear free in [\x:T->U. \y:T. x y]

(** ** Substitution *)

(** To prove that substitution preserves typing, we first need a
    technical lemma connecting free variables and typing contexts: If
    a variable [x] appears free in a term [t], and if we know [t] is
    well typed in context [Gamma], then it must be the case that
    [Gamma] assigns a type to [x]. *)

Lemma free_in_context : forall x t T Gamma,
   appears_free_in x t ->
   Gamma |- t \in T ->
   exists T', Gamma x = Some T'.

(** _Proof_: We show, by induction on the proof that [x] appears free
      in [t], that, for all contexts [Gamma], if [t] is well typed
      under [Gamma], then [Gamma] assigns some type to [x].

      - If the last rule used is [afi_var], then [t = x], and from the
        assumption that [t] is well typed under [Gamma] we have
        immediately that [Gamma] assigns a type to [x].

      - If the last rule used is [afi_app1], then [t = t1 t2] and [x]
        appears free in [t1].  Since [t] is well typed under [Gamma],
        we can see from the typing rules that [t1] must also be, and
        the IH then tells us that [Gamma] assigns [x] a type.

      - Almost all the other cases are similar: [x] appears free in a
        subterm of [t], and since [t] is well typed under [Gamma], we
        know the subterm of [t] in which [x] appears is well typed
        under [Gamma] as well, and the IH gives us exactly the
        conclusion we want.

      - The only remaining case is [afi_abs].  In this case [t =
        \y:T11.t12] and [x] appears free in [t12], and we also know
        that [x] is different from [y].  The difference from the
        previous cases is that, whereas [t] is well typed under
        [Gamma], its body [t12] is well typed under [(y|->T11; Gamma],
        so the IH allows us to conclude that [x] is assigned some type
        by the extended context [(y|->T11; Gamma].  To conclude that
        [Gamma] assigns a type to [x], we appeal to lemma
        [update_neq], noting that [x] and [y] are different
        variables. *)

    [Gamma |- t \in T], we will need to replace [Gamma] by a different

    [Gamma] to all the variables that appear free in [t]. In fact,
    this is the only condition that is needed. *)

Lemma context_invariance : forall Gamma Gamma' t T,
     Gamma |- t \in T  ->
     (forall x, appears_free_in x t -> Gamma x = Gamma' x) ->
     Gamma' |- t \in T.

(** _Proof_: By induction on the derivation of [Gamma |- t \in T].

      - If the last rule in the derivation was [T_Var], then [t = x]
        and [Gamma x = T].  By assumption, [Gamma' x = T] as well, and
        hence [Gamma' |- t \in T] by [T_Var].

      - If the last rule was [T_Abs], then [t = \y:T11. t12], with [T
        = T11 -> T12] and [y|->T11; Gamma |- t12 \in T12].  The
        induction hypothesis is that, for any context [Gamma''], if
        [y|->T11; Gamma] and [Gamma''] assign the same types to
        all the free variables in [t12], then [t12] has type [T12]
        under [Gamma''].  Let [Gamma'] be a context which agrees with
        [Gamma] on the free variables in [t]; we must show [Gamma' |-
        \y:T11. t12 \in T11 -> T12].

        By [T_Abs], it suffices to show that [y|->T11; Gamma' |-
        t12 \in T12].  By the IH (setting [Gamma'' = y|->T11;Gamma']), 
        it suffices to show that [y|->T11;Gamma] 
        and [y|->T11;Gamma'] agree on all the variables that
        appear free in [t12].

        Any variable occurring free in [t12] must be either [y] or
        some other variable.  [y|->T11; Gamma] and [y|->T11; Gamma'] 
        clearly agree on [y].  Otherwise, note that any
        variable other than [y] that occurs free in [t12] also occurs
        free in [t = \y:T11. t12], and by assumption [Gamma] and
        [Gamma'] agree on all such variables; hence so do [y|->T11; Gamma] 
        and [y|->T11; Gamma'].

      - If the last rule was [T_App], then [t = t1 t2], with [Gamma |-
        t1 \in T2 -> T] and [Gamma |- t2 \in T2].  One induction
        hypothesis states that for all contexts [Gamma'], if [Gamma']
        agrees with [Gamma] on the free variables in [t1], then [t1]
        has type [T2 -> T] under [Gamma']; there is a similar IH for
        [t2].  We must show that [t1 t2] also has type [T] under
        [Gamma'], given the assumption that [Gamma'] agrees with
        [Gamma] on all the free variables in [t1 t2].  By [T_App], it
        suffices to show that [t1] and [t2] each have the same type
        under [Gamma'] as under [Gamma].  But all free variables in
        [t1] are also free in [t1 t2], and similarly for [t2]; hence
        the desired result follows from the induction hypotheses. *)

(** Now we come to the conceptual heart of the proof that reduction
    preserves types -- namely, the observation that _substitution_
    preserves types. *)

(** Formally, the so-called _substitution lemma_ says this:
    Suppose we have a term [t] with a free variable [x], and suppose
    we've assigned a type [T] to [t] under the assumption that [x] has
    some type [U].  Also, suppose that we have some other term [v] and
    that we've shown that [v] has type [U].  Then, since [v] satisfies
    the assumption we made about [x] when typing [t], we can
    substitute [v] for each of the occurrences of [x] in [t] and
    obtain a new term that still has type [T]. *)

(** _Lemma_: If [x|->U; Gamma |- t \in T] and [|- v \in U],
    then [Gamma |- [x:=v]t \in T]. *)

Lemma substitution_preserves_typing : forall Gamma x U t v T,
  (x |-> U ; Gamma) |- t \in T ->
  empty |- v \in U   ->
  Gamma |- [x:=v]t \in T.

(** One technical subtlety in the statement of the lemma is that
    we assume [v] has type [U] in the _empty_ context -- in other
    words, we assume [v] is closed.  This assumption considerably
    simplifies the [T_Abs] case of the proof (compared to assuming
    [Gamma |- v \in U], which would be the other reasonable assumption
    at this point) because the context invariance lemma then tells us
    that [v] has type [U] in any context at all -- we don't have to
    worry about free variables in [v] clashing with the variable being
    introduced into the context by [T_Abs].

    The substitution lemma can be viewed as a kind of "commutation
    property."  Intuitively, it says that substitution and typing can
    be done in either order: we can either assign types to the terms
    [t] and [v] separately (under suitable contexts) and then combine
    them using substitution, or we can substitute first and then
    assign a type to [ [x:=v] t ] -- the result is the same either
    way.

    _Proof_: We show, by induction on [t], that for all [T] and
    [Gamma], if [x|->U; Gamma |- t \in T] and [|- v \in U], then
    [Gamma |- [x:=v]t \in T].

      - If [t] is a variable there are two cases to consider,
        depending on whether [t] is [x] or some other variable.

          - If [t = x], then from the fact that [x|->U; Gamma |-
            x \in T] we conclude that [U = T].  We must show that
            [[x:=v]x = v] has type [T] under [Gamma], given the
            assumption that [v] has type [U = T] under the empty
            context.  This follows from context invariance: if a
            closed term has type [T] in the empty context, it has that
            type in any context.

          - If [t] is some variable [y] that is not equal to [x], then
            we need only note that [y] has the same type under 
            [x|->U; Gamma] as under [Gamma].

      - If [t] is an abstraction [\y:T11. t12], then the IH tells us,
        for all [Gamma'] and [T'], that if [x|->U; Gamma' |- t12
        \in T'] and [|- v \in U], then [Gamma' |- [x:=v]t12 \in T'].

        The substitution in the conclusion behaves differently
        depending on whether [x] and [y] are the same variable.

        First, suppose [x = y].  Then, by the definition of
        substitution, [[x:=v]t = t], so we just need to show [Gamma |-
        t \in T].  But we know [x|->U; Gamma |- t \in T], and,
        since [y] does not appear free in [\y:T11. t12], the context
        invariance lemma yields [Gamma |- t \in T].

        Second, suppose [x <> y].  We know [y|->T11; x|->U; Gamma
        |- t12 \in T12] by inversion of the typing relation.
        Since [x <> y], we have 
        [y|->T11; x|->U; Gamma = x|->U; y|->T11; Gamma].
        So the IH applies, giving us
        [y|->T11; Gamma |- [x:=v]t12 \in T12].  

      - If [t] is an application [t1 t2], the result follows
        straightforwardly from the definition of substitution and the
        induction hypotheses.

      - The remaining cases are similar to the application case.

    _Technical note_: This proof is a rare case where an induction on
    terms, rather than typing derivations, yields a simpler argument.
    The reason for this is that the assumption [x|->U; Gamma |- t
    \in T] is not completely generic, in the sense that one of the
    "slots" in the typing relation -- namely the context -- is not
    just a variable, and this means that Coq's native induction tactic
    does not give us the induction hypothesis that we want.  It is
    possible to work around this, but the needed generalization is a
    little tricky.  The term [t], on the other hand, is completely
    generic. *)

    - We can immediately rule out [T_Var], [T_Abs], [T_Tru], and
      [T_Fls] as final rules in the derivation, since in each of these
      cases [t] cannot take a step.

    - If the last rule in the derivation is [T_App], then [t = t1 t2],
      and there are subderivations showing that [|- t1 \in T11->T] and
      [|- t2 \in T11] plus two induction hypotheses: (1) [t1 --> t1']
      implies [|- t1' \in T11->T] and (2) [t2 --> t2'] implies [|- t2'
      \in T11].  There are now three subcases to consider, one for
      each rule that could be used to show that [t1 t2] takes a step
      to [t'].

        - If [t1 t2] takes a step by [ST_App1], with [t1] stepping to
          [t1'], then, by the first IH, [t1'] has the same type as
          [t1] ([|- t1 \in T11->T]), and hence by [T_App] [t1' t2] has
          type [T].

        - The [ST_App2] case is similar, using the second IH.

        - If [t1 t2] takes a step by [ST_AppAbs], then [t1 =
          \x:T11.t12] and [t1 t2] steps to [[x:=t2]t12]; the desired
          result now follows from the substitution lemma.

    - If the last rule in the derivation is [T_Test], then [t = test
      t1 then t2 else t3], with [|- t1 \in Bool], [|- t2 \in T], and
      [|- t3 \in T], and with three induction hypotheses: (1) [t1 -->
      t1'] implies [|- t1' \in Bool], (2) [t2 --> t2'] implies [|- t2'
      \in T], and (3) [t3 --> t3'] implies [|- t3' \in T].

      There are again three subcases to consider, depending on how [t]
      steps.

        - If [t] steps to [t2] or [t3] by [ST_TestTru] or
          [ST_TestFalse], the result is immediate, since [t2] and [t3]
          have the same type as [t].

        - Otherwise, [t] steps by [ST_Test], and the desired
          conclusion follows directly from the first induction
          hypothesis. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, recommended (subject_expansion_stlc) 

    An exercise in the [Types] chapter asked about the _subject
    expansion_ property for the simple language of arithmetic and
    boolean expressions.  This property did not hold for that language, 
    and it also fails for STLC.  That is, it is not always the case that, 
    if [t --> t'] and [has_type t' T], then [empty |- t \in T].  
    Show this by giving a counter-example that does _not involve 
    conditionals_.

    You can state your counterexample informally in words, with a brief 
    explanation. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Exercise: STLC with Arithmetic *)

(** To see how the STLC might function as the core of a real
    programming language, let's extend it with a concrete base
    type of numbers and some constants and primitive
    operators. *)

Module STLCArith.
Import STLC.

(** To types, we add a base type of natural numbers (and remove
    booleans, for brevity). *)

Inductive ty : Type :=
  | Arrow : ty -> ty -> ty
  | Nat  : ty.

(** To terms, we add natural number constants, along with
    successor, predecessor, multiplication, and zero-testing. *)

Inductive tm : Type :=
  | var : string -> tm
  | app : tm -> tm -> tm
  | abs : string -> ty -> tm -> tm
  | const  : nat -> tm
  | scc : tm -> tm
  | prd : tm -> tm
  | mlt : tm -> tm -> tm
  | test0 : tm -> tm -> tm -> tm.

(** **** Exercise: 5 stars, standard (stlc_arith) 

    Finish formalizing the definition and properties of the STLC
    extended with arithmetic. This is a longer exercise. Specifically:

    1. Copy the core definitions for STLC that we went through,
        as well as the key lemmas and theorems, and paste them
        into the file at this point. Do not copy examples, exercises,
        etc. (In particular, make sure you don't copy any of the []
        comments at the end of exercises, to avoid confusing the
        autograder.)

        You should copy over five definitions:
          - Fixpoint susbt
          - Inductive value
          - Inductive step
          - Inductive has_type
          - Inductive appears_free_in

        And five theorems, with their proofs:
          - Lemma context_invariance
          - Lemma free_in_context
          - Lemma substitution_preserves_typing
          - Theorem preservation
          - Theorem progress

        It will be helpful to also copy over "Reserved Notation",
        "Notation", and "Hint Constructors" for these things.

    2. Edit and extend the five definitions (subst, value, step,
        has_type, and appears_free_in) so they are appropriate
        for the new STLC extended with arithmetic.

    3. Extend the proofs of all the five properties of the original
        STLC to deal with the new syntactic forms. Make sure Coq
        accepts the whole file. *)
