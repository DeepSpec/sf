(** * Adding Records *)

(** We saw in chapter [MoreStlc] how records can be treated as just
    syntactic sugar for nested uses of products.  This is OK for
    simple examples, but the encoding is informal (in reality, if we
    actually treated records this way, it would be carried out in the
    parser, which we are eliding here), and anyway it is not very
    efficient.  So it is also interesting to see how records can be
    treated as first-class citizens of the language.  This chapter
    shows how.

    Recall the informal definitions we gave before: *)

(**
    Syntax:

       t ::=                          Terms:
           | {i1=t1, ..., in=tn}         record
           | t.i                         projection
           | ...

       v ::=                          Values:
           | {i1=v1, ..., in=vn}         record value
           | ...

       T ::=                          Types:
           | {i1:T1, ..., in:Tn}         record type
           | ...

   Reduction:

                               ti ==> ti'                            
  -------------------------------------------------------------------- (ST_Rcd)
  {i1=v1, ..., im=vm, in=tn, ...} ==> {i1=v1, ..., im=vm, in=tn', ...}

                                 t1 ==> t1'
                               --------------                        (ST_Proj1)
                               t1.i ==> t1'.i

                          -------------------------                (ST_ProjRcd)
                          {..., i=vi, ...}.i ==> vi

   Typing:

               Gamma |- t1 : T1     ...     Gamma |- tn : Tn
             --------------------------------------------------         (T_Rcd)
             Gamma |- {i1=t1, ..., in=tn} : {i1:T1, ..., in:Tn}

                       Gamma |- t : {..., i:Ti, ...}
                       -----------------------------                   (T_Proj)
                             Gamma |- t.i : Ti

(** * Formalizing Records *)

Module STLCExtendedRecords.

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Syntax and Operational Semantics *)

(** The most obvious way to formalize the syntax of record types would
    be this: *)

Module FirstTry.

Definition alist (X : Type) := list (string * X).

Inductive ty : Type :=
  | Base     : string -> ty
  | Arrow    : ty -> ty -> ty
  | TRcd      : (alist ty) -> ty.

(** Unfortunately, we encounter here a limitation in Coq: this type
    does not automatically give us the induction principle we expect:
    the induction hypothesis in the [TRcd] case doesn't give us
    any information about the [ty] elements of the list, making it
    useless for the proofs we want to do.  *)

(* Check ty_ind.
   ====>
    ty_ind :
      forall P : ty -> Prop,
        (forall i : id, P (Base i)) ->
        (forall t : ty, P t -> forall t0 : ty, P t0 
                            -> P (Arrow t t0)) ->
        (forall a : alist ty, P (TRcd a)) ->    (* ??? *)
        forall t : ty, P t
*)

End FirstTry.

(** It is possible to get a better induction principle out of Coq, but
    the details of how this is done are not very pretty, and the
    principle we obtain is not as intuitive to use as the ones Coq
    generates automatically for simple [Inductive] definitions.

    Fortunately, there is a different way of formalizing records that
    is, in some ways, even simpler and more natural: instead of using
    the standard Coq [list] type, we can essentially incorporate its
    constructors ("nil" and "cons") in the syntax of our types. *)

Inductive ty : Type :=
  | Base : string -> ty
  | Arrow : ty -> ty -> ty
  | RNil : ty
  | RCons : string -> ty -> ty -> ty.

(** Similarly, at the level of terms, we have constructors [trnil],
    for the empty record, and [rcons], which adds a single field to
    the front of a list of fields. *)

Inductive tm : Type :=
  | var : string -> tm
  | app : tm -> tm -> tm
  | abs : string -> ty -> tm -> tm
  (* records *)
  | rproj : tm -> string -> tm
  | trnil :  tm
  | rcons : string -> tm -> tm -> tm.

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Well-Formedness *)

(** One issue with generalizing the abstract syntax for records from
    lists to the nil/cons presentation is that it introduces the
    possibility of writing strange types like this... *)

Definition weird_type := RCons X A B.

(** where the "tail" of a record type is not actually a record type! *)

(** We'll structure our typing judgement so that no ill-formed types
    like [weird_type] are ever assigned to terms.  To support this, we
    define predicates [record_ty] and [record_tm], which identify
    record types and terms, and [well_formed_ty] which rules out the
    ill-formed types. *)

(** First, a type is a record type if it is built with just [RNil]
    and [RCons] at the outermost level. *)

Inductive record_ty : ty -> Prop :=
  | RTnil :
        record_ty RNil
  | RTcons : forall i T1 T2,
        record_ty (RCons i T1 T2).

(** With this, we can define well-formed types. *)

        record_ty T2 ->
        well_formed_ty (RCons i T1 T2).

Hint Constructors record_ty well_formed_ty.

(** Note that [record_ty] is not recursive -- it just checks the
    outermost constructor.  The [well_formed_ty] property, on the
    other hand, verifies that the whole type is well formed in the
    sense that the tail of every record (the second argument to
    [RCons]) is a record.

    Of course, we should also be concerned about ill-formed terms, not
    just types; but typechecking can rule those out without the help
    of an extra [well_formed_tm] definition because it already
    examines the structure of terms.  All we need is an analog of
    [record_ty] saying that a term is a record term if it is built
    with [trnil] and [rcons]. *)

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Typing *)

(** Next we define the typing rules.  These are nearly direct
    transcriptions of the inference rules shown above: the only
    significant difference is the use of [well_formed_ty].  In the
    informal presentation we used a grammar that only allowed
    well-formed record types, so we didn't have to add a separate
    check.

    One sanity condition that we'd like to maintain is that, whenever
    [has_type Gamma t T] holds, will also be the case that
    [well_formed_ty T], so that [has_type] never assigns ill-formed
    types to terms.  In fact, we prove this theorem below.  However,
    we don't want to clutter the definition of [has_type] with
    unnecessary uses of [well_formed_ty].  Instead, we place
    [well_formed_ty] checks only where needed: where an inductive call
    to [has_type] won't already be checking the well-formedness of a
    type.  For example, we check [well_formed_ty T] in the [T_Var]
    case, because there is no inductive [has_type] call that would
    enforce this.  Similarly, in the [T_Abs] case, we require a proof
    of [well_formed_ty T11] because the inductive call to [has_type]
    only guarantees that [T12] is well-formed. *)

Fixpoint Tlookup (i:string) (Tr:ty) : option ty :=

(** *** Field Lookup *)

(** Lemma: If [empty |- v : T] and [Tlookup i T] returns [Some Ti],
     then [tlookup i v] returns [Some ti] for some term [ti] such
     that [empty |- ti \in Ti].

    Proof: By induction on the typing derivation [Htyp].  Since
      [Tlookup i T = Some Ti], [T] must be a record type, this and
      the fact that [v] is a value eliminate most cases by inspection,
      leaving only the [T_RCons] case.

      If the last step in the typing derivation is by [T_RCons], then
      [t = rcons i0 t tr] and [T = RCons i0 T Tr] for some [i0],
      [t], [tr], [T] and [Tr].

      This leaves two possiblities to consider - either [i0 = i] or
      not.

      - If [i = i0], then since [Tlookup i (RCons i0 T Tr) = Some
        Ti] we have [T = Ti].  It follows that [t] itself satisfies
        the theorem.

      - On the other hand, suppose [i <> i0].  Then

        Tlookup i T = Tlookup i Tr

        and

        tlookup i t = tlookup i tr,

        so the result follows from the induction hypothesis. []
