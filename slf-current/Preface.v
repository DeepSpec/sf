(** * Preface: Introduction to the Course *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Welcome *)

(** This electronic book is Volume 6 of the _Software Foundations_
    series, which presents the mathematical underpinnings of reliable
    software.

    In this volume, you will learn about the foundations of Separation
    Logic, a practical approach to the modular verification of
    imperative programs. In particular, this volume presents the
    building blocks for constructing a program verification tool. It
    does not, however, focus on reasoning about data structures and
    algorithms using Separation Logic. This aspect is covered to some
    extent by Volume 5 of _Software Foundations_, which presents
    Verifiable C, a program logic and proof system for C. For OCaml
    programs, this aspect will be covered in a yet-to-be-written
    volume presenting CFML, a tool that builds upon all the techniques
    presented in this volume.

    You are only assumed to understand the material in _Software
    Foundations_ Volume 1 (_Logical Foundations_), and the two
    chapters on Hoare Logic (Hoare and Hoare2) from Software
    Foundations Volume 2 (_PL Foundations_). The reading of Volume 5
    is not a prerequisite. The exposition here is intended for a broad
    range of readers, from advanced undergraduates to PhD students and
    researchers.

    A large fraction of the contents of this course is also written up
    in traditional LaTeX-style presentation, in the ICFP'20 article:
    _Separation Logic for Sequential Programs_, by Arthur Chargu√©raud.
    The long version of this paper is available at this link:
    http://www.chargueraud.org/research/2020/seq_seplogic/seq_seplogic.pdf

    This paper includes, in particular, a 5-page historical survey of
    contributions to mechanized presentations of Separation Logic,
    featuring 100+ citations. For a broader survey of Separation
    Logic, we recommend Peter O'Hearn's 2019 survey, which is
    available from: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3211968 --
    including the _supplemental material_ linked near the bottom of
    that page. *)

(** * Separation Logic *)

(** Separation Logic is a _program logic_: it enables one to establish
    that a program satisfies its specification. Specifications are expressed
    using triples of the form [{H} t {Q}]. Whereas in Hoare logic the
    precondition [H] and the postcondition [Q] describe the whole memory
    state, in Separation Logic, [H] and [Q] describe only a fragment of the
    memory state. This fragment includes the resources necessary to the
    execution of [t].

    A key ingredient of Separation Logic is the frame rule, which enables
    modular proofs. It is stated as follows.

         { H } t { Q }
    -------------------------
     { H \* H' } t { Q \* H' }

    The above rule asserts that if a term [t] executes correctly with the
    resources [H] and produces [Q], then the term [t] admits the same
    behavior in a larger memory state, described by the union of [H]
    with a disjoint component [H'], producing the postcondition [Q] extended
    with that same resource [H'] unmodified. The star symbol [\*] denotes the
    _separating conjunction_ operator of Separation Logic.

    Separation Logic can be exploited in three kind of tools.

    - Automated proofs: the user provides only the code, and the tool
      locates sources of potential bugs. A good automated tool provides
      feedback that, most of time, is relevant.
    - Semi-automated proofs: the user provides not just the code,
      but also specifications and invariants. The tool then leverages
      automated solvers (e.g., SMT solvers) to discharge proof obligations.
    - Interactive proofs: the user provides not just the code and its
      specifications, but also a detailed proof script justifying the
      correctness of the code. These proofs may be worked on interactively
      using a proof assistant such as Coq.

    The present course focuses on the third approach, that is, the integration
    of Separation Logic in an interactive proof assistant. This approach
    has been successfully put to practice throughout the world, using
    various proof assistants (Coq, Isabelle/HOL, HOL), targeting different
    languages (Assembly, C, SML, OCaml, Rust...), and for verifying various
    kind of programs, ranging from low-level operating system kernels
    to high-level data structures and algorithms. *)

(** * Separation Logic in a proof assistant *)

(** The benefits of exploiting Separation Logic in a proof assistant
    include at least four major points:

    - higher-order logic provides virtually unlimited expressiveness
      that enables formulating arbitrarily complex specifications and
      invariants;
    - a proof assistant provides a unified framework to prove both
      the implementation details of the code and the underlying
      mathematical results form, e.g., results from theory or graph
      theory;
    - proof scripts may be easily maintained to reflect on a change
      to the source code;
    - the fact that Separation Logic is formalized in the proof
      assistant provides high confidence in the correctness of the tool.

    Pretty much all the tools that leverage Separation Logic in a proof
    assistant are constructed following the same schema:

    - A formalization of the syntax and semantics of the source language.
      This is called a _deep embedding_ of the programming language.
    - A definition of Separation Logic predicates as predicates from
      higher-order logic. This is called a _shallow embedding_ of the
      program logic.
    - A definition of Separation Logic triples as a predicate, the
      statements of the reasoning rules as lemmas, and the proof of
      these reasoning rules with respect to the semantics.
    - An infrastructure that consists of lemmas, tactics and notation,
      allowing for the verification of concrete programs to be carried out
      through relatively concise proof scripts.
    - Applications of this infrastructure to the verification of concrete
      programs.

    The purpose of this course is to explain how to set up such a construction.
    To that end, we consider in this course the simplest possible variant of
    Separation Logic, and apply it to a minimalistic imperative programming
    language. The language essentially consists of a lambda-calculus with
    references. This language admits a simple semantics and avoids in
    particular the need to distinguish between stack variables and heap-
    allocated variables. Advanced chapters from the course explains how
    to add support for loops, records, arrays, and n-ary functions. *)

(** * Several Possible Depths of Reading *)

(** The material is organized in such a way that it can be easily adapted to
    the amount of time that the reader is ready to invest in the course.

    The course contains 13 chapters, not counting the [Preface],
    [Postscript], and [Bib] chapters. The course is organized in 3
    major parts, as pictured in the roadmap diagram.

    - The short curriculum includes only the 5 first chapters (ranging from
      chapter [Basic] to chapter [Rules]).
    - The medium curriculum includes 3 additional chapters (ranging from
      chapter [WPsem] to chapter [Wand]).
    - The full curriculum includes 5 more chapters (ranging from
      chapter [Partial] to chapter [Rich]).

    In addition, each chapter except [Basic] is decomposed in three parts.

    - The _First Pass_ section presents the most important ideas only.
      The course in designed in such a way that it is possible to read only
      the _First Pass_ section of every chapter. The reader may be interested
      in going through all these sections to get the big picture, before
      revisiting each chapter in more details.
    - The _More Details_ section presents additional material explaining
      in more depth the meaning and the consequences of the key results.
      This section also contains descriptions of the most important proofs.
      By default, readers would eventually read all this material.
    - The _Optional Material_ section typically contains the remaining
      proofs, as well as discussions of alternative definitions. The _Optional
      Material_ sections are all independent from each other. They would
      typically be of interest to readers who want to understand every detail,
      readers who are seeking for a deep understanding of a particular notion,
      and readers who are looking for answers to specific question. *)

(** * List of Chapters *)

(** The first two chapters, namely chapters [Basic] and [Repr]
    give a primer on how to prove imperative programs in Separation Logic,
    thus focusing on the end user's perspective. All the other chapters
    focus on the implementor's perspective, explaining how Separation Logic
    is defined and how a practical verification tool can be constructed.

    The list of chapters appears below. The numbering corresponds to _teaching
    units_: if the chapters were taught as part of a University course, one
    could presumably aim to cover one teaching unit per week.

    - (1) [Basic]: introduction to the core features of Separation Logic,
          illustrated using short programs manipulating references.

    - (1) [Repr]: introduction to representation predicates in Separation
          Logic, in particular for describing mutable lists and trees.

    - (2) [Hprop]: definition of the core operators of Separation Logic,
          of Hoare triples, and of Separation Logic triples.

    - (2) [Himpl]: definition of the entailment relation, statement and
          proofs of its fundamental properties, and description of the
          simplification tactic for entailment.

    - (3) [Rules]: statement and proofs of the reasoning rules of
          Separation Logic, and example proofs of programs using these rules.

    - (4) [WPsem]: definition of the semantic notion of weakest
          precondition, and statement of rules in weakest-precondition style.

    - (4) [WPgen]: presentation of a function that effectively computes
          the weakest precondition of a term, independently of its
          specification.

    - (5) [Wand]: introduction of the magic wand operator and of the
          ramified frame rule, and extension of the weakest-precondition
          generator for handling local function definitions.

    - (5) [Affine]: description of a generalization of Separation Logic
          with affine heap predicates, which are useful, in particular, for
          handling garbage-collected programming languages.

    - (6) [Struct]: specification of array and record operations, and
          encoding of these operations using pointer arithmetic.

    - (6) [Rich]: description of the treatment of additional language
          constructs, including loops, assertions, and n-ary functions.

    - (7) [Nondet]: definition of triples for non-deterministic
          programming languages.

    - (7) [Partial]: definition of triples for partial correctness
          only, i.e., for not requiring termination proofs. *)

(** * Other Distributed Files *)

(** The chapters listed above depend on a number of auxiliary files, which
    the reader does not need to go through, but might be interested in
    looking at, either by curiosity, or for checking out a specific
    implementation detail.

    - [LibSepReference]: a long file that defines the program
      verification tool that is used in the first two chapters, and
      whose implementation is discussed throughout the other chapters.
      Each chapter from the course imports this module, as opposed to
      importing the chapters that precedes it.

    - [LibSepVar]: a formalization of program variables, together with
      a bunch of notations for parsing variables.

    - [LibSepFmap]: a formalization of finite maps, which are used for
      representing the memory state.

    - [LibSepSimpl]: a functor that implements a powerful tactic for
      automatically simplifying entailments in Separation Logic.

    - [LibSepMinimal]: a minimalistic formalization of a soundness
      proof for Separation Logic, corresponding to the definitions and proofs
      presented in the ICFP'20 paper mentioned earlier.

    - All other [Lib*] files are imports from the TLC library,
      which is described next. *)

(** The TLC library is a collection of general purpose theory and tactics
    developed over the years by Arthur Chargu√©raud. The TLC library is
    exploited in this course to streamline the presentation. TLC provides,
    in particular, extensions for classical logic and tactics that are
    particularly well-suited for meta-theory. Prior knowledge of TLC is not
    required, and all exercises can be completed without using TLC tactics.

    The classical logic aspects of TLC are presented at the moment they
    appear in the course. The TLC tactics are also briefly described upon
    their first occurrence. Moreover, most of these tactics are presented
    in the chapter [UseTactics] of Software Foundations Volume 2
    (_Programming Language Foundations_). *)
