(** * A First Taste *)

(** This chapter gives an overview of the basic features of Separation Logic, by
    means of examples. Example programs are specified and verified using a
    Separation Logic framework whose construction is explained throughout the
    course. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Parsing of Programs *)

(** The programs we consider are written within Coq, using a "custom grammar"
    that allows writing code that reads almost like OCaml code. For example,
    consider the function [incr], which increments the contents of a mutable
    cell that stores an integer. In OCaml syntax, this function could be defined
    as:

OCaml:

  let incr =
    fun p ->
      let n = !p in
      let m = n + 1 in
      p := m
*)

(** In Coq, the corresponding program is described as shown below. The function
    defined, named [incr], admits the type [val]. This type is defined by the
    framework. Observe that all variable names are prefixed with a quote symbol.
    This presentation avoids conflict between program variables and Coq
    constants. *)

Definition incr : val :=
  <{ fun 'p =>
       let 'n = !'p in
       let 'm = 'n + 1 in
       'p := 'm }>.

(** There is no need to learn how to write programs in this custom syntax:
    source code is provided for all the programs involved in this course. *)

(** To simplify the implementation of the framework and the reasoning about
    programs, we make throughout the course the simplifying assumption that
    programs are written in "A-normal form": all intermediate expressions must
    be named using a let-binding. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Specification of the Increment Function *)

(** The specification of [incr p] is expressed using a "Separation Logic
    triple", that is, a predicate of the form [triple t H Q]. The term [t] here
    corresponds to the application of the function [incr] to the argument [p].
    We could write this application in the form [<{ incr p }>], using the custom
    syntax for parsing programs.

    The components [H] and [Q] correspond to the precondition and to the
    postcondition, which are explained next. To improve readability, we follow
    the convention of writing both the precondition and the postcondition on
    separate lines. *)

Lemma triple_incr : forall (p:loc) (n:int),
  triple <{ incr p }>
    (p ~~> n)
    (fun _ => (p ~~> (n+1))).

(** In the specification above, [p] denotes the "location" -- that is, the
    address in memory of the reference cell provided as argument to the
    increment function. Locations have type [loc] in the framework.

    The precondition is written [p ~~> n]. This Separation Logic predicate
    describes a memory state in which the contents of the location [p] is the
    value [n]. In the present example, [n] stands for an integer value.

    The behavior of the operation [incr p] consists of updating the memory state
    by incrementing the contents of the cell at location [p], updating its
    contents to [n+1]. Thus, the memory state posterior to the increment
    operation is described by the predicate [p ~~> (n+1)].

    The result value returned by [incr p] is the unit value, which does not
    carry any useful information. In the specification of [incr], the
    postcondition is of the form [fun _ => ...], indicating that there is no
    need to bind a name for the unit result value. *)

(** The general pattern of a specification admits the following scheme.

    - Quantification of the arguments of the functions---here, the variable
      [p].
    - Quantification of the "ghost variables" used to describe the input
      state---here, the variable [n].
    - The application of the predicate [triple] to the function application
      [incr p]---here, the term being specified by the triple.
    - The precondition describing the input state---here, the predicate
      [p ~~> n].
    - The postcondition describing both the output value and the output state.
      The general pattern is [fun r => H'], where [r] names the result and
      [H'] describes the final state. Here, [r] is just an underscore symbol,
      and the final state is described by [p ~~> (n+1)]. *)

(** Note that we have to write [p ~~> (n+1)] using parentheses around [n+1],
    because otherwise [p ~~> n+1] would get parsed as [(p ~~> n) + 1]. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Verification of the Increment Function *)

(** Our next step is to prove the specification lemma [triple_incr] which
    specifies the behavior of the function [incr]. We conduct the proof using
    tactics provided by the frameworks, collectively called "x-tactics" because
    their names all start with the letter "x". These tactics include [xwp] for
    starting a proof, [xapp] for reasoning about a function call, and [xsimpl]
    for proving that a description of a state entails another one. *)

Proof.
(** [xwp] begins the verification proof. *)
  xwp.
(** The proof obligation is displayed using a custom notation of the form
    [PRE H CODE F POST Q]. In the [CODE] section, one should be able to somewhat
    recognize the body of [incr]. Indeed, if we ignore the back-ticks and
    perform the alpha-renaming from [v] to [n] and [v0] to [m], the [CODE]
    section reads like:

      <[ Let n := App val_get p in
         Let m := App val_add n 1 in
         App val_set p ) ]>

    which is somewhat similar to the original source code, but displayed using a
    special syntax whose meaning will be explained in chapter [WPgen]. *)

(** The remainder of the proof performs essentially a symbolic execution of the
    code. At each step, one should not attempt to read the full proof
    obligation, but instead only look at the current state, described by the
    [PRE] part (here, [p ~~> n]), and at the first line only of the [CODE] part,
    which corresponds to the next operation to reason about. Each of the
    operations involved here is handled using the tactic [xapp]. *)

(** First, we reason about the operation [!p] that reads into [p]; this read
    operation returns the value [n]. *)
  xapp.
(** Second, we reason about the addition operation [n+1]. *)
  xapp.
(** Third, we reason about the update operation [p := n+1], thereby updating the
    state to [p ~~> (n+1)]. *)
  xapp.
(** At this stage, the proof obligation takes the form [H1 ==> H2]. It requires
    us to check that the final state matches what is claimed in the
    postcondition. We discharge it using the tactic [xsimpl]. *)
  xsimpl.
Qed.

(** This completes the verification of the lemma [triple_incr], which
    establishes a formal specification for the increment function. Before moving
    on to another function, we add the lemma [triple_incr] to a hint database
    called [triple], using the command shown below. If at some point we verify a
    function that includes a call to [incr], the [xapp] tactic will be able to
    automatically invoke the lemma [triple_incr]. *)

#[global] Hint Resolve triple_incr : triple.

(** To minimize the amount of syntactic noise in specifications, we leverage an
    advanced feature of Coq's coercion mechanism. Concretely, instead of writing
    the specification in the form [triple <{ incr p }> ...], we write it in the
    form [triple (incr p) ...], that is, with just parentheses. Thanks to the
    coercion mecanism, explained in more detail in chapter [Rules], when
    Coq sees a "program value" [incr] being applied to an argument [p], it
    automatically interprets this as a "program function call" of [incr] to [p].
    Thus, the specification of the increment function can be written as follows.
    *)

Lemma triple_incr' : forall (p:loc) (n:int),
  triple (incr p)
    (p ~~> n)
    (fun _ => (p ~~> (n+1))).
Proof.
  (* Here, to view coercions, use [Set Printing Coercions.] *)
  xwp. xapp. xapp. xapp. xsimpl.
Qed.

(** The existence of implicit coercions might be a little confusing at times,
    but coercions make specifications so much more readable that it would be a
    pity to not exploit them. *)

(** The reader may be curious to know what the notation [PRE H CODE F POST Q]
    stands for, and what the x-tactics are doing. Everything will be explained
    as we move through the course. This chapter and the next avoid such
    explanations to focus on surveying the features of Separation Logic and
    showing how x-tactics can be used to verify programs. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** A Function with a Return Value *)

(** As a second example, let us specify a function that performs simple
    arithmetic computations. The function, whose code appears below, expects an
    integer argument [n] (in [Z]). It evaluates [a] as [n+1], then evaluates [b]
    as [n-1], and finally returns the sum [a+b]. The function thus always
    returns [2*n]. *)

Definition example_let : val :=
  <{ fun 'n =>
      let 'a = 'n + 1 in
      let 'b = 'n - 1 in
      'a + 'b }>.

(** The specification takes the form [triple (example_let n) H (fun r => H')],
    where [r], of type [val], denotes the output value.

    The precondition [H] describes what we need to assume about the input state.
    For this function, we need not assume anything, hence we write [\[]] to
    denote the empty precondition. The program might have allocated data prior
    to the call to the function [example_let], but this function will not
    interfere in any way with this previously allocated data.

    The postcondition describes what the function produces. More precisely, the
    postcondition specifies both the output that the function returns and the
    data from memory that the function has allocated, accessed, or updated. The
    function [example_let] does not interact with the memory, thus the
    postcondition could be described using the empty predicate [\[]].

    Yet, if we write just [fun (r:val) => \[]] as postcondition, we would have
    said nothing about the output value [r] produced by a call [example_let].
    Instead, we would like to specify that the result [r] is equal to [2*n]. To
    that end, we write the postcondition [fun r => \[r = 2*n]]. Here, we use the
    predicate format [\[P]], which allows to embed "pure facts", of type [Prop]
    in preconditions and postconditions.

    The equality [r = 2*n] actually resolves to [r = val_int (2*n)], where
    [val_int] is a coercion that translates the integer value [2*n] into the
    corresponding integer value, of type [val], from the programming language.
    If you do not know what a coercion is, just ignore the previous sentence. *)

Lemma triple_example_let : forall (n:int),
  triple (example_let n)
    \[]
    (fun r => \[r = 2*n]).

(** The proof script is quite similar to the previous one: [xwp] begins the
    proof, [xapp] performs symbolic execution. and [xsimpl] simplifies the
    entailment. Ultimately, we need to check that the expression computed,
    [(n + 1) + (n - 1)], is equal to the specified result, that is, [2*n]. To
    prove this equality, we invoke the tactic [math] provided by the TLC
    library. Recall from the preface that this course leverages TLC for enhanced
    definitions and tactics. (Technically, [math] is a wrapper around the
    standard Coq tactic [lia]; this wrapper is needed because TLC uses different
    definitions for arithmetic inequalities than Coq's standard library.) *)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard, especially useful (triple_quadruple) *)

(** Consider the function [quadruple], which expects an integer [n] and returns
    its quadruple, that is, the value [4*n]. *)

Definition quadruple : val :=
  <{ fun 'n =>
       let 'm = 'n + 'n in
       'm + 'm }>.

(** Specify and verify the function [quadruple] to express that it returns
    [4*n]. Follow the pattern of the previous proof. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, especially useful (triple_inplace_double) *)

(** Consider the function [inplace_double], which expects a reference to an
    integer, reads its contents, then updates the contents with the double of
    the original value. *)

Definition inplace_double : val :=
  <{ fun 'p =>
       let 'n = !'p in
       let 'm = 'n + 'n in
       'p := 'm }>.

(** Specify and verify the function [inplace_double], following the pattern of
    the first example, [triple_incr]. *)

(* FILL IN HERE *)

(** [] *)

(** From here on, we use the command [Proof using] for introducing a proof
    instead of writing just [Proof]. Writing [Proof using.] tells Coq that the
    proof of the lemma does not depend on section variables others than the ones
    involved for typechecking the statement of the lemma. The [Proof using.]
    enables Coq to compile proofs in parallel when the [-vos] flag is passed.

(** * Separation Logic Operators *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Increment of Two References *)

(** Consider the following function, which expects the addresses of two
    reference cells and increments both of them. *)

Definition incr_two : val :=
  <{ fun 'p 'q =>
       incr 'p;
       incr 'q }>.

(** The specification of this function takes the form
    [triple (incr_two p q) H (fun _ => H')], where again the underscore symbol
    denotes the unit result value.

    The precondition describes two references cells: [p ~~> n] and [q ~~> m]. To
    assert that the two cells are distinct from each other, we separate their
    description with the operator [\*]. Thus, the precondition is
    [(p ~~> n) \* (q ~~> m)], or simply [p ~~> n \* q ~~> m]. The operator [\*]
    is called the "separating conjunction" of Separation Logic. It is also known
    as the "star" operator.

    The postcondition describes the final state in a similar way, as
    [p ~~> (n+1) \* q ~~> (m+1)]. This predicate reflects the fact that both
    references have their contents increased by one unit.

    The specification triple for [incr_two] is thus as follows. *)

Lemma triple_incr_two : forall (p q:loc) (n m:int),
  triple (incr_two p q)
    (p ~~> n \* q ~~> m)
    (fun _ => p ~~> (n+1) \* q ~~> (m+1)).
Proof using.
  xwp. xapp. xapp. xsimpl.
Qed.

(** We will make use of the function [incr_two] later in this chapter, so we
    register the specification [triple_incr_two] in the [triple] database. *)

#[global] Hint Resolve triple_incr_two : triple.

(** Separation Logic expressions such as [p ~~> n] or [\[]] or [H1 \* H2] are
    called "heap predicates", because they corresponding to predicates over
    "heaps", i.e., over memory states. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Aliased Arguments *)

(** The specification [triple_incr_two] describes the behavior of calls to the
    function [incr_two] _only_ when the two arguments provided correspond to
    distinct reference cells. It says nothing at all about a call of the form
    [incr_two p p]. Indeed, in Separation Logic, a state described by [p ~~> n]
    cannot be matched against a state described by [p ~~> n \* p ~~> n], because
    the star operator requires its operand to correspond to disjoint pieces of
    state.

    What happens if we nevertheless try to exploit [triple_incr_two] to reason
    about a call of the form [incr_two p p], that is, with aliased arguments?
    Let's find out, by considering the operation [aliased_call p], which does
    execute such a call. *)

Definition aliased_call : val :=
  <{ fun 'p =>
       incr_two 'p 'p }>.

(** A call to [aliased_call p] increases the contents of [p] by [2]. This
    property can be specified as follows. *)

Lemma triple_aliased_call : forall (p:loc) (n:int),
  triple (aliased_call p)
    (p ~~> n)
    (fun _ => p ~~> (n+2)).

(** If we attempt the proof, we get stuck. The tactic [xapp] reports its failure
    by issuing a proof obligation of the form [\[] ==> (p ~~> ?m) \* _]. This
    proof obligation requires us to show that, from the empty heap predicate
    state, one can extract a heap predicate [p ~~> ?m] describing a reference at
    location [p] with some integer contents [?m]. *)

Proof using.
  xwp. xapp.
Abort.

(** On the one hand, the precondition of the specification [triple_incr_two],
    with [q = p], requires providing [p ~~> ?n \* p ~~> ?m]. On the other hand,
    the current state is described as [p ~~> n]. When trying to match the two,
    the internal simplification tactic [xsimpl] is able to cancel out one
    occurrence of [p ~~> n] from both expressions, but then there remains to
    match the empty heap predicate [\[]] against [(p ~~> ?m)]. The issue here is
    that the specification [triple_incr_two] is specialized for the case of
    "non-aliased" references. *)

(** One thing we can do is to state and prove an alternative specification for
    the function [incr_two] to cover the case of aliased arguments. The
    precondition of this alternative specification mentions a single reference,
    [p ~~> n]. Its postcondition asserts that the contents of that reference is
    increased by two units. This alternative specification is stated and proved
    as follows. *)

Lemma triple_incr_two_aliased : forall (p:loc) (n:int),
  triple (incr_two p p)
    (p ~~> n)
    (fun _ => p ~~> (n+2)).
Proof using.
  xwp. xapp. xapp. xsimpl. math.
Qed.

(** By exploiting the alternative specification for [incr_two], we are able to
    prove the specification of the function [aliased_call]. In order to indicate
    to the tactic [xapp] that it should not invoke the lemma [triple_incr_two]
    registered for [incr_two], but instead invoke the lemma
    [triple_incr_two_aliased], we provide that lemma as an explicit argument to
    [xapp], writing [xapp triple_incr_two_aliased]. *)

Lemma triple_aliased_call : forall (p:loc) (n:int),
  triple (aliased_call p)
    (p ~~> n)
    (fun _ => p ~~> (n+2)).
Proof using.
  xwp. xapp triple_incr_two_aliased. xsimpl.
Qed.

(** Taking a step back, it may be somewhat disappointing that we need two
    different specifications for the same function, depending on whether its
    arguments are aliased on not. There are advanced features of Separation
    Logic that do allow handling the two cases through a single specification.
    However, for such a simple function, it is easiest to just state and prove
    the two specifications separately. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** A Function that Takes Two References and Increments One *)

(** Consider the following function, which expects the addresses of two
    reference cells and increments only the first one. What is interesting about
    this function is precisely the fact that it does nothing with its second
    argument. *)

Definition incr_first : val :=
  <{ fun 'p 'q =>
       incr 'p }>.

(** We can specify this function by describing its input state as
    [p ~~> n \* q ~~> m] and describing its output state as
    [p ~~> (n+1) \* q ~~> m]. Formally: *)

Lemma triple_incr_first : forall (p q:loc) (n m:int),
  triple (incr_first p q)
    (p ~~> n \* q ~~> m)
    (fun _ => p ~~> (n+1) \* q ~~> m).
Proof using.
  xwp. xapp. xsimpl.
Qed.

(** The second reference plays absolutely no role in the execution of the
    function. Thus, we could equally well consider a specification that mentions
    only the first reference. *)

Lemma triple_incr_first' : forall (p q:loc) (n:int),
  triple (incr_first p q)
    (p ~~> n)
    (fun _ => p ~~> (n+1)).
Proof using.
  xwp. xapp. xsimpl.
Qed.

(** Interestingly, the specification [triple_incr_first], which mentions the two
    references, is derivable from the specification [triple_incr_first'], which
    mentions only the first. To prove the implication, it suffices to invoke the
    tactic [xapp] with argument [triple_incr_first']. *)

Lemma triple_incr_first_derived : forall (p q:loc) (n m:int),

(** More generally, in Separation Logic, if a specification triple holds, then
    this triple remains valid when we add the same heap predicate to both the
    precondition and the postcondition. This is the "frame" principle, a key
    modularity feature that we'll come back to later on in the course. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Transfer from one Reference to Another *)

(** Consider the [transfer] function, whose code appears below. Recall that, to
    simplify the implementation of the framework used in the course, we need to
    write in A-normal form, assigning a name to every intermediate result. *)

Definition transfer : val :=

       'q := 0 }>.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Specification of Allocation *)

(** Consider the operation [ref v], which allocates a memory cell with contents
    [v]. How can we specify this operation using a triple? The precondition of
    this triple should be the empty heap predicate, written [\[]], because the
    allocation can execute in an empty state. The postcondition should assert
    that the output value is a pointer [p], such that the final state is
    described by [p ~~> v].

    It would be tempting to write the postcondition [fun p => p ~~> v]. Yet, the
    triple would be ill-typed, because the postcondition of a triple must be a
    predicate over values, of type [val] in the framework, whereas here [p] is
    an address, of type [loc]. We thus need to write the postcondition in the
    form [fun (r:val) => H'], where [r] denotes the result value, and somehow
    assert that [r] is the value that corresponds to the location [p]. This
    value is written [val_loc p], where [val_loc] denotes the constructor that
    injects locations into the grammar of program values.

    To formally quantify the variable [p], we use the existential quantifier for
    heap predicates, written [\exists]. The correct postcondition for [ref v] is
    thus [fun r => \exists (p:loc), \[r = val_loc p] \* (p ~~> v)]. The complete
    statement of the specification of [ref] appears below. It is introduced as a
    [Parameter] instead of a [Lemma], because the proof of the specification of
    this primitive operation is postponed to the chapter [Rules]. *)

Parameter triple_ref : forall (v:val),
  triple <{ ref v }>
    \[]
    (fun r => \exists p, \[r = val_loc p] \* p ~~> v).

(** The pattern [fun r => \exists p, \[r = val_loc p] \* H)] occurs whenever a
    function returns a pointer. To improve concision for this frequent pattern,
    we introduce a specific notation: [funloc p => H]. *)

Notation "'funloc' p '=>' H" :=
  (fun (r:val) => \exists p, \[r = val_loc p] \* H)
  (at level 200, p name, format "'funloc'  p  '=>'  H").

(** Using this notation, the specification [triple_ref] can be reformulated more
    concisely: *)

Parameter triple_ref' : forall (v:val),
  triple <{ ref v }>
    \[]
    (funloc p => p ~~> v).

(** The CFML tool, which leverages techniques similar to those described in this
    course, leverages type-classes to generalize the notation [funloc] to all
    return types. Here, in order to avoid technical difficulties associated with
    type-classes, we will not go for the general presentation, but instead
    exploit the [funloc] notation, which is specific to the case where the
    return type is a location. For other types, we can quantify over the result
    value explicitly. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Allocation of a Reference with Greater Contents *)

(** Consider the function [ref_greater], which takes as argument the address [p]
    of a memory cell with contents [n], allocates a fresh memory cell with
    contents [n+1], and returns the address of that fresh cell. *)

Definition ref_greater : val :=
  <{ fun 'p =>
       let 'n = !'p in
       let 'm = 'n + 1 in
       ref 'm }>.

(** The precondition of [ref_greater] asserts the existence of a cell [p ~~> n].
    The postcondition asserts the existence of two cells, [p ~~> n] and
    [q ~~> (n+1)], where [q] denotes the location returned by the function. The
    postcondition is thus written [funloc q => p ~~> n \* q ~~> (n+1)], which is
    a shorthand for
    [fun (r:val) => \exists q, \[r = val_loc q] \* p ~~> n \* q ~~> (n+1)]. In
    the proof below, observe that the operation [ref] is displayed as [val_ref],
    because this is the name of the operation in the internal abstrat syntax
    tree. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, especially useful (triple_ref_greater_abstract)

    State another specification for the function [ref_greater] with a
    postcondition that does not reveal the contents of the fresh reference [q],
    but instead only asserts that it is greater than the contents of [p]. To
    that end, introduce in the postcondition an existentially quantified
    variable called [m], with [m > n]. This new specification, to be called
    [triple_ref_greater_abstract], should be derived from [triple_ref_greater],
    following the proof pattern employed in [triple_incr_first_derived].

    Hint: Remember that the notation [\[P]] injects a Coq proposition into the
    language of Separation Logic predicates. *)

(** ** The Power of the Frame Rule with Respect to Allocation *)

(** Recall the specification [triple_ref'], which describes the behavior of an
    allocation of a memory cell with contents [v], performed at location [p].

  Parameter triple_ref' : forall (v:val),
    triple <{ ref v }>
      \[]
      (funloc p => p ~~> v).
*)

(** According to the frame rule presented in the preface, the above
    specification would remain valid if we extend the precondition and the
    postcondition with a heap predicate. Consider, for example, extending the
    precondition with the predicate [p' ~~> v']. By doing so, we derive a lemma
    describing the behavior of the allocation of a cell at location [p],
    starting from a state that already contains a cell allocated at location
    [p']. *)

Parameter triple_ref_with_frame : forall (p':loc) (v':val) (v:val),
  triple <{ ref v }>
    (p' ~~> v')
    (funloc p => p ~~> v \* p' ~~> v').

(** The separating conjunction that appears in the above postcondition captures
    the fact that the location [p] is distinct from [p']. As illustrated here,
    the frame rule indirectly captures the property that any piece of freshly
    allocated data is distinct from any piece of previously existing data. This
    property may seem obvious, but in the work on program verification prior to
    Separation Logic it was challenging to capture. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Deallocation in Separation Logic *)

(** Separation Logic, in its simplest form, enforces that every piece of
    allocated data is eventually deallocated. But OCaml is a programming
    language equipped with a garbage collector: programs do not contain explicit
    deallocation operations.

    Thus, concretely, if we consider an OCaml program that allocates a
    reference, and if this reference is not described in the postcondition, we
    get stuck in the proof. Let us see how we get stuck and what we can do about
    it. *)

(** To begin with, consider the function shown below. This function computes the
    successor of a integer [n]. It does so using a reference: it first stores
    [n] into a reference cell, then it increments that reference, and finally it
    returns the new contents of the reference. *)

Definition succ_using_incr_attempt :=
  <{ fun 'n =>
       let 'p = ref 'n in
       incr 'p;
       ! 'p }>.

(** A call to that function can be specified using an empty precondition and a
    postcondition asserting that the final result is equal to [n+1]. The
    postcondition has no reason to mention the reference used internally by the
    function. But we get stuck on the last step when trying to prove this
    specification. *)

Lemma triple_succ_using_incr_attempt : forall (n:int),
  triple (succ_using_incr_attempt n)
    \[]
    (fun r => \[r = n+1]).
Proof using.
  xwp. xapp. intros p. xapp. xapp. xsimpl. { auto. }
Abort.

(** We get stuck with the unprovable entailment [p ~~> (n+1) ==> \[]], where the
    left-hand side describes a state with one reference, whereas the right-hand
    side describes an empty state. There are three possibilities to work around
    the issue. *)

(** The first possibility consists of extending the postcondition to account for
    the existence of the reference [p]. This yields a provable specification. *)

Lemma triple_succ_using_incr_attempt' : forall (n:int),
  triple (succ_using_incr_attempt n)
    \[]

Proof using.
  xwp. xapp. intros p. xapp. xapp. xsimpl. { auto. }
Qed.

(** However, while the specification above is provable, it is pretty
    unsatisfying. The postcondition [\exists p, p ~~> (n+1)] is of absolutely no
    use to the caller of the function. Worse, the caller will get its own heap
    predicate polluted with [\exists p, p ~~> (n+1)], with no way of throwing
    away this predicate. *)

(** A second solution is to alter the code to include an explicit free
    operation, written [free p], for deallocating the reference. This operation
    does not exist in OCaml, but let us nevertheless assume it to be able to
    demonstrate how Separation Logic supports reasoning about explicit
    deallocation. *)

       incr 'p;
       let 'x = !'p in
       free 'p;
       'x }>.

(** This program may be proved correct with respect to the intended
    postcondition [fun r => \[r = n+1]], without the need to mention [p]. In the
    proof below, the key step is the last call to [xapp]. This call is for
    reasoning about the operation [free p], which consumes the heap predicate
    [p ~~> _]. At the last proof step, we invoke the tactic [xval] for reasoning
    about the return value. When applied to a piece of code that consists of a
    value [v], in a precondition [H] and a postcondition [Q], [xval] transforms
    the goal into [H ==> Q v], which asserts that the current state matches the
    state described by the postcondition, for the return value at hand. *)

(** ** A Partial Recursive Function, Without State *)

(** As a warm-up, we first consider consider a recursive function that does not
    involve any mutable state. The program function [factorec] computes the
    factorial of its argument: it implements the logical function [facto].

OCaml:

    let rec factorec n =
      if n <= 1
        then 1
        else n * factorec (n-1)

    The corresponding code in A-normal form is slightly more verbose. *)

Definition factorec : val :=
  <{ fix 'f 'n =>
       let 'b = 'n <= 1 in
       if 'b
         then 1
         else let 'x = 'n - 1 in
              let 'y = 'f 'x in
              'n * 'y }>.

(** A call to [factorec n] can be specified as follows:

    - the initial state is empty,
    - the final state is empty,
    - the result value [r] is such that [r = facto n], when [n >= 0].

    In case [n < 0], we have two choices:

    - either we explicitly specify that the result is [1] in this case,
    - or we rule out this possibility by requiring [n >= 0].

    Let us follow the second approach, in order to illustrate the specification
    of partial functions.

    There are two possibilities for expressing the constraint [n >= 0]:

    - either we use as precondition [\[n >= 0]],
    - or we we use the empty precondition, that is, [\[]], and we place an
      assumption [(n >= 0) -> _] at the front of the triple.

    The two presentations are formally equivalent, but we prefer the second,
    which tends to improve both the readability of specifications and the
    conciseness of proof scripts. In that style, the specification of [factorec]
    is stated as follows. *)

Lemma triple_factorec : forall n,
  n >= 0 ->
  triple (factorec n)
    \[]
    (fun r => \[r = facto n]).

(** In general, we prove specifications for recursive functions by exploiting a
    strong induction principle statement ("well-founded induction") that allows
    us to assume, while we try to prove the specification, that the
    specification already holds for any "smaller input". The (well-founded)
    order relation that defines whether an input is smaller than another one is
    specified by the user. In the present example of [factorec], we use the
    well-founded relation [downto 0], where [downto 0 m n] asserts that
    [0 <= m < n].

    Let's walk through the proof script in detail, to see how to set up the
    induction, how we exploit it for reasoning about the recursive call, and how
    we justify that the recursive call is made on a smaller input. *)

Proof using.
(** We set up a proof by induction on [n] to obtain an induction hypothesis for
    the recursive calls. The tactic [induction_wf], provided by the TLC library,

    Certainly, we expect the proof to get stuck if [m < 0]. Indeed, in this
    case, the call to [repeat_incr p m] terminates immediately, so the final
    state is [p ~~> n], like the initial state, and the final state does not
    match the claimed postcondition [p ~~> (n + m)]. Let us investigate how the
    proof of lemma [triple_repeat_incr] breaks. *)

(** When the specification includes the assumption [m >= 0], we can prove this
    equality because the fact that we are in the else branch means that
    [m <= 0], thus [m = 0]. However, without the assumption [m >= 0], the value
    of [m] could very well be negative. In that case, the equality [n = n + m]
    is unprovable. As users, the proof obligation [(m <= 0) -> (n = n + m)]
    gives us a very strong hint that either the code or the specification is not
    handling the case [m < 0] properly.

    This concludes our example attempt at proving an incorrect specification. *)

(** There exists a valid specification for [repeat_incr] that does not constrain

(** * Summary *)

(** This chapter introduced the following notions:

    - "Heap predicates", which are used to describe memory states in Separation
      Logic.
    - "Specification triples" of the form [triple t H Q], which relate a term
      [t], a precondition [H], and a postcondition [Q].
    - "Verification triples", of the form [PRE H CODE F POST Q], are triples of
      a specific form, produced by the framework.
    - "Entailments", of the form [H ==> H'] or [Q ===> Q'], which assert that
      one pre- or post-condition is weaker than another one.
    - Custom proof tactics, called "x-tactics", which are specialized tactics
      for discharging these proof obligations.

    Several specific heap predicates for describing memory states were presented
    in this introductory chapter. They include:

    - [p ~~> n], which describes a memory cell at location [p] with contents
      [n],
    - [\[]], which describes an empty state,
    - [\[P]], which also describes an empty state and moreover asserts that the
      proposition [P] is true,
    - [H1 \* H2], which describes a state made of two disjoint parts, one
      satisfying [H1] and another satisfying [H2],
    - [\exists x, H], which is used to quantify variables in postconditions.

    All these heap predicates have type [hprop], which describes predicates over
    memory states. A memory state has type [heap], thus [hprop] is defined as
    [heap->Prop].

    The verification of practical programs is carried out using x-tactics,
    identified by the leading "x" letter in their name. These tactics include:

    - [xwp] to begin a proof,
    - [xapp] to reason about an application,
    - [xval] to reason about a return value,
    - [xif] to reason about a conditional,
    - [xsimpl] to simplify or prove entailments ([H ==> H'] and [Q ===> Q']).

    In addition to x-tactics, the proof scripts exploit standard Coq tactics, as
    well as tactics from the TLC library, which provides a bunch of useful,
    general purpose tactics. In this chapter, we used a few TLC tactics:

    - [math], which is a variant of [lia] for proving mathematical goals,
    - [induction_wf], which sets up proofs by well-founded induction,
    - [gen], for generalizing variables for inductions. *)

(** The function [factoimp n] correctly computes the factorial of [n] not just
    when [n >= 1], but also when [n = 0]. Yet, the argument for justifying this
    fact is not entirely straightforward. A naive approach would be to develop a
    separate proof that [factoimp 0] returns [1]. Such a separate proof would
    look as follows. *)

  i = 1 ->
  n = 0 ->

  { xval. xsimpl. subst.
    rewrite facto_init; [|math].
    rewrite facto_init; [|math]. auto. }

  n = 0 ->
  triple (factoimp n)
    \[]
    (fun r => \[r = facto n]).

  introv Hn. xwp. xapp. intros r.
(** Here we invoke the specification of [factoimp_aux] specialized for the case

  xapp triple_factoimp_aux_zero. { math. } { math. }
  { rewrite* facto_init. { math. } }
  xapp. xapp. xval. xsimpl. auto.
Qed.

(** What we have done here is to go twice over the whole code, once to verify
    correctness in the case [n >= 1], and once for the case [n = 0]. Going twice
    over the same piece of code is, in general, bad practice. Indeed, the
    resulting script involves a fair amount of duplication. Fortunately, in most
    situations it is possible to verify code in a single pass. In the present
    example, it suffices to consider as precondition the disjunction of the two
    possible cases: either [i = 1 /\ n = 0] or [0 <= i <= n]. *)

    the case analysis as late in the proof as possible, in order to avoid
    duplication. *)

(** * Historical Notes *)

(** The key ideas of Separation Logic were devised by John Reynolds, inspired in
    part by older work by [Burstall 1972] (in Bib.v). Reynolds presented his ideas in
    lectures given in the fall of 1999. The proposed rules turned out to be
    unsound, but [Ishtiaq and O'Hearn 2001] (in Bib.v) noticed a strong relationship
    with the logic of bunched implications by [O'Hearn and Pym 1999] (in Bib.v),
    leading to ideas on how to set up a sound program logic. Soon afterwards,
    the seminal publications on Separation Logic appeared at the CSL workshop
    [O'Hearn, Reynolds, and Yang 2001] (in Bib.v) and at the LICS conference
    [Reynolds 2002] (in Bib.v).

    The Separation Logic specifications and proof scripts using x-tactics
    presented in this file are directly adapted from the CFML tool (2010-2023),
    developed mainly by Arthur Charguéraud. The notations for Separation Logic
    predicates are directly inspired from those introduced in the Ynot project
    [Chlipala et al 2009] (in Bib.v). See chapter [Bib] for references. *)
