<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 This electronic book is Volume 6 of the <i>Software Foundations</i>
    series, which presents the mathematical underpinnings of reliable
    software.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    In this volume, you will learn about the foundations of Separation
    Logic, a practical approach to the modular verification of
    imperative programs. In particular, this volume presents the
    building blocks for constructing a program verification tool. It
    does not, however, focus on reasoning about data structures and
    algorithms using Separation Logic. This aspect is covered to some
    extent by Volume 5 of <i>Software Foundations</i>, which presents
    Verifiable C, a program logic and proof system for C. For OCaml
    programs, this aspect will be covered in a yet-to-be-written
    volume presenting CFML, a tool that builds upon all the techniques
    presented in this volume.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    You are only assumed to understand the material in <i>Software
    Foundations</i> Volume 1 (<i>Logical Foundations</i>), and the two
    chapters on Hoare Logic (Hoare and Hoare2) from Software
    Foundations Volume 2 (<i>PL Foundations</i>). The reading of Volume 5
    is not a prerequisite. The exposition here is intended for a broad
    range of readers, from advanced undergraduates to PhD students and
    researchers.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    A large fraction of the contents of this course is also written up
    in traditional LaTeX-style presentation, in the ICFP'20 article:
    <i>Separation Logic for Sequential Programs</i>, by Arthur Charguéraud.
    The long version of this paper is available at this link:
    <a href='http://www.chargueraud.org/research/2020/seq_seplogic/seq_seplogic.pdf'>http://www.chargueraud.org/research/2020/seq_seplogic/seq_seplogic.pdf</a>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This paper includes, in particular, a 5-page historical survey of
    contributions to mechanized presentations of Separation Logic,
    featuring 100+ citations. For a broader survey of Separation
    Logic, we recommend Peter O'Hearn's 2019 survey, which is
    available from: <a href='https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3211968'>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3211968</a>--
    including the <i>supplemental material</i> linked near the bottom of
    that page. 
</div>

<div class="doc">
<a id="lab2"></a><h1 class="section">Separation Logic</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Separation Logic is a <i>program logic</i>: it enables one to establish
    that a program satisfies its specification. Specifications are expressed
    using triples of the form <span class="inlinecode">{<span class="id" title="var">H</span>}</span> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">t</span></span> <span class="inlinecode">{<span class="id" title="var">Q</span>}</span>. Whereas in Hoare logic the
    precondition <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">H</span></span> and the postcondition <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">Q</span></span> describe the whole memory
    state, in Separation Logic, <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">H</span></span> and <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">Q</span></span> describe only a fragment of the
    memory state. This fragment includes the resources necessary to the
    execution of <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">t</span></span>.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    A key ingredient of Separation Logic is the frame rule, which enables
    modular proofs. It is stated as follows.
<center><table class="infrule">
<tr class="infruleassumption">
  <td class="infrule">{ H } t { Q }</td>
  <td class="infrulenamecol" rowspan="3">
    &nbsp;
  </td></tr>
<tr class="infrulemiddle">
  <td class="infrule"><hr /></td>
</tr>
<tr class="infruleassumption">
  <td class="infrule">{ H <span class='gray-font'>\</span>* H' } t { Q <span class='gray-font'>\</span>* H' }</td>
  <td></td>
</td>
</table></center>    The above rule asserts that if a term <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">t</span></span> executes correctly with the
    resources <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">H</span></span> and produces <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">Q</span></span>, then the term <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">t</span></span> admits the same
    behavior in a larger memory state, described by the union of <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">H</span></span>
    with a disjoint component <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">H'</span></span>, producing the postcondition <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">Q</span></span> extended
    with that same resource <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">H'</span></span> unmodified. The star symbol <span class="inlinecode"><span class='gray-font'>\</span>*</span> denotes the
    <i>separating conjunction</i> operator of Separation Logic.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Separation Logic can be exploited in three kind of tools.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> Automated proofs: the user provides only the code, and the tool
      locates sources of potential bugs. A good automated tool provides
      feedback that, most of time, is relevant.

</li>
<li> Semi-automated proofs: the user provides not just the code,
      but also specifications and invariants. The tool then leverages
      automated solvers (e.g., SMT solvers) to discharge proof obligations.

</li>
<li> Interactive proofs: the user provides not just the code and its
      specifications, but also a detailed proof script justifying the
      correctness of the code. These proofs may be worked on interactively
      using a proof assistant such as Coq.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The present course focuses on the third approach, that is, the integration
    of Separation Logic in an interactive proof assistant. This approach
    has been successfully put to practice throughout the world, using
    various proof assistants (Coq, Isabelle/HOL, HOL), targeting different
    languages (Assembly, C, SML, OCaml, Rust...), and for verifying various
    kind of programs, ranging from low-level operating system kernels
    to high-level data structures and algorithms. 
</div>

<div class="doc">
<a id="lab3"></a><h1 class="section">Separation Logic in a proof assistant</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The benefits of exploiting Separation Logic in a proof assistant
    include at least four major points:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> higher-order logic provides virtually unlimited expressiveness
      that enables formulating arbitrarily complex specifications and
      invariants;

</li>
<li> a proof assistant provides a unified framework to prove both
      the implementation details of the code and the underlying
      mathematical results form, e.g., results from theory or graph
      theory;

</li>
<li> proof scripts may be easily maintained to reflect on a change
      to the source code;

</li>
<li> the fact that Separation Logic is formalized in the proof
      assistant provides high confidence in the correctness of the tool.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Pretty much all the tools that leverage Separation Logic in a proof
    assistant are constructed following the same schema:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> A formalization of the syntax and semantics of the source language.
      This is called a <i>deep embedding</i> of the programming language.

</li>
<li> A definition of Separation Logic predicates as predicates from
      higher-order logic. This is called a <i>shallow embedding</i> of the
      program logic.

</li>
<li> A definition of Separation Logic triples as a predicate, the
      statements of the reasoning rules as lemmas, and the proof of
      these reasoning rules with respect to the semantics.

</li>
<li> An infrastructure that consists of lemmas, tactics and notation,
      allowing for the verification of concrete programs to be carried out
      through relatively concise proof scripts.

</li>
<li> Applications of this infrastructure to the verification of concrete
      programs.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The purpose of this course is to explain how to set up such a construction.
    To that end, we consider in this course the simplest possible variant of
    Separation Logic, and apply it to a minimalistic imperative programming
    language. The language essentially consists of a lambda-calculus with
    references. This language admits a simple semantics and avoids in
    particular the need to distinguish between stack variables and heap-
    allocated variables. Advanced chapters from the course explains how
    to add support for loops, records, arrays, and n-ary functions. 
</div>

<div class="doc">
<a id="lab4"></a><h1 class="section">Several Possible Depths of Reading</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The material is organized in such a way that it can be easily adapted to
    the amount of time that the reader is ready to invest in the course.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The course contains 13 chapters, not counting the <a href="Preface.html"><span class="inlineref">Preface</span></a>,
    <a href="Postscript.html"><span class="inlineref">Postscript</span></a>, and <a href="Bib.html"><span class="inlineref">Bib</span></a> chapters. The course is organized in 3
    major parts, as pictured in the roadmap diagram.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> The short curriculum includes only the 5 first chapters (ranging from
      chapter <a href="Basic.html"><span class="inlineref">Basic</span></a> to chapter <a href="Rules.html"><span class="inlineref">Rules</span></a>).

</li>
<li> The medium curriculum includes 3 additional chapters (ranging from
      chapter <a href="WPsem.html"><span class="inlineref">WPsem</span></a> to chapter <a href="Wand.html"><span class="inlineref">Wand</span></a>).

</li>
<li> The full curriculum includes 5 more chapters (ranging from
      chapter <a href="Partial.html"><span class="inlineref">Partial</span></a> to chapter <a href="Rich.html"><span class="inlineref">Rich</span></a>).

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    In addition, each chapter except <a href="Basic.html"><span class="inlineref">Basic</span></a> is decomposed in three parts.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> The <i>First Pass</i> section presents the most important ideas only.
      The course in designed in such a way that it is possible to read only
      the <i>First Pass</i> section of every chapter. The reader may be interested
      in going through all these sections to get the big picture, before
      revisiting each chapter in more details.

</li>
<li> The <i>More Details</i> section presents additional material explaining
      in more depth the meaning and the consequences of the key results.
      This section also contains descriptions of the most important proofs.
      By default, readers would eventually read all this material.

</li>
<li> The <i>Optional Material</i> section typically contains the remaining
      proofs, as well as discussions of alternative definitions. The <i>Optional
      Material</i> sections are all independent from each other. They would
      typically be of interest to readers who want to understand every detail,
      readers who are seeking for a deep understanding of a particular notion,
      and readers who are looking for answers to specific question. 

</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="doc">
<a id="lab5"></a><h1 class="section">List of Chapters</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The first two chapters, namely chapters <a href="Basic.html"><span class="inlineref">Basic</span></a> and <a href="Repr.html"><span class="inlineref">Repr</span></a>
    give a primer on how to prove imperative programs in Separation Logic,
    thus focusing on the end user's perspective. All the other chapters
    focus on the implementor's perspective, explaining how Separation Logic
    is defined and how a practical verification tool can be constructed.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The list of chapters appears below. The numbering corresponds to <i>teaching
    units</i>: if the chapters were taught as part of a University course, one
    could presumably aim to cover one teaching unit per week.

</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The TLC library is a collection of general purpose theory and tactics
    developed over the years by Arthur Charguéraud. The TLC library is
    exploited in this course to streamline the presentation. TLC provides,
    in particular, extensions for classical logic and tactics that are
    particularly well-suited for meta-theory. Prior knowledge of TLC is not
    required, and all exercises can be completed without using TLC tactics.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The classical logic aspects of TLC are presented at the moment they
    appear in the course. The TLC tactics are also briefly described upon
    their first occurrence. Moreover, most of these tactics are presented
    in the chapter <a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/UseTactics.html"><span class="inlineref">UseTactics</span></a> of Software Foundations Volume 2
