<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 This electronic book is Volume 6 of the <i>Software Foundations</i> series, which
    presents the mathematical underpinnings of reliable software.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    *COMPANION COURSE NOTES*: A large part of this course is also written up in
    traditional LaTeX-style presentation. It's available from
    <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">http</span>://<span class="id" title="var">www.chargueraud.org</span>/<span class="id" title="var">teach</span>/<span class="id" title="var">verif</span>/<span class="id" title="var">slf_notes.pdf</span></span>.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This book will teach you about the foundations of Separation Logic, a
    practical approach to the modular verification of imperative programs. In
    particular, it presents the building blocks for constructing a program
    verification tool. It does not, however, focus on reasoning about data
    structures and algorithms using Separation Logic. This aspect is covered to
    some extent by Volume 5 of <i>Software Foundations</i>, which presents Verifiable
    C, a program logic and proof system for C. For OCaml programs, this aspect
    will be covered in a yet-to-be-written volume presenting CFML, a tool that
    builds upon all the techniques presented in this volume.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    You are only assumed to understand the material in <i>Software Foundations</i>
    Volume 1 (<i>Logical Foundations</i>), and the two chapters on Hoare Logic (Hoare
    and Hoare2) from Software Foundations Volume 2 (<i>PL Foundations</i>). Volume 5
    is not a prerequisite. The exposition here is intended for a broad range of
    readers, from advanced undergraduates to PhD students and researchers. 
</div>

<div class="doc">
<a id="lab2"></a><h1 class="section">Separation Logic</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Separation Logic is a <i>program logic</i>: it enables one to establish that a
    program satisfies its specification. Specifications are expressed using
    triples of the form <span class="inlinecode">{<span class="id" title="var">H</span>}</span> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">t</span></span> <span class="inlinecode">{<span class="id" title="var">Q</span>}</span>. Whereas in Hoare logic the precondition <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">H</span></span>
    and the postcondition <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">Q</span></span> describe the whole memory state, in Separation
    Logic <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">H</span></span> and <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">Q</span></span> describe only a fragment of the memory state that includes
    the resources necessary to the execution of <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">t</span></span>.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    A key ingredient of Separation Logic is the frame rule, which enables
    modular proofs. It is stated as follows.
<center><table class="infrule">
<tr class="infruleassumption">
  <td class="infrule">{ H } t { Q }</td>
  <td class="infrulenamecol" rowspan="3">
    &nbsp;
  </td></tr>
<tr class="infrulemiddle">
  <td class="infrule"><hr /></td>
</tr>
<tr class="infruleassumption">
  <td class="infrule">{ H <span class='gray-font'>\</span>* H' } t { Q <span class='gray-font'>\</span>* H' }</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
</table></center>    The above rule asserts that if, a term <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">t</span></span> executes correctly with the
    resources <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">H</span></span> and produces <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">Q</span></span>, then <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">t</span></span> admits the same behavior in a
    larger memory state, described by the union of <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">H</span></span> with a disjoint component
    <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">H'</span></span>, producing the postcondition <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">Q</span></span> extended with that same resource <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">H'</span></span>
    unmodified. The star symbol <span class="inlinecode"><span class='gray-font'>\</span>*</span> denotes the <i>separating conjunction</i>
    operator of Separation Logic.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Separation Logic can be exploited in three kind of tools.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> Automated proofs: the user provides only the code, and the tool
      locates sources of potential bugs. A good automated tool provides
      feedback that (at least most of time) is relevant.

</li>
<li> Semi-automated proofs: the user provides not just the code,
      but also specifications and invariants. The tool then leverages
      automated solvers (e.g., SMT solvers) to discharge proof obligations.

</li>
<li> Interactive proofs: the user provides not just the code and its
      specifications, but also a detailed proof script justifying the
      correctness of the code. These proofs may be developed interactively
      using a proof assistant such as Coq.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The present course focuses on the third approach, that is, the integration
    of Separation Logic in an interactive proof assistant. This approach has
    been successfully put to practice throughout the world, using various proof
    assistants (Coq, Isabelle/HOL, HOL), targeting different languages
    (Assembly, C, SML, OCaml, Rust...) and for verifying various kind of
    programs, ranging from low-level operating system kernels to high-level data
    structures and algorithms. 
</div>

<div class="doc">
<a id="lab3"></a><h1 class="section">Separation Logic in a Proof Assistant</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The benefits of exploiting Separation Logic in a proof assistant include at
    least four major points:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> higher-order logic provides virtually unlimited expressiveness
      that enables formulating arbitrarily complex specifications and
      invariants;

</li>
<li> a proof assistant provides a unified framework to prove both
      the implementation details of the code and the underlying
      mathematical results, e.g., results from number theory or graph
      theory;

</li>
<li> proof scripts may be easily maintained to reflect changes
      to the source code; and

</li>
<li> the fact that Separation Logic itself is formalized in the proof
      assistant provides high confidence in the correctness of the tool.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Pretty much all the tools that leverage Separation Logic in proof assistants
    are constructed following the same schema:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> A formalization of the syntax and semantics of the source language.
      This is called a <i>deep embedding</i> of the programming language.

</li>
<li> A definition of Separation Logic predicates as predicates in
      higher-order logic. This is called a <i>shallow embedding</i> of the
      program logic.

</li>
<li> A definition of Separation Logic triples as a predicate, the
      statements of the reasoning rules as lemmas, and the proof of
      these reasoning rules with respect to the semantics.

</li>
<li> An infrastructure that consists of lemmas, tactics and notations,
      allowing for the verification of concrete programs to be carried out
      through relatively concise proof scripts.

</li>
<li> Applications of this infrastructure to the verification of concrete
      programs.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The purpose of this course is to explain how to set up such a construction.
    To that end, we consider in this course the simplest possible variant of
    Separation Logic, and apply it to a minimalistic imperative programming
    language. The language essentially consists of a lambda-calculus with
    references. This language admits a simple semantics. It avoids, in
    particular, the need to distinguish between stack variables and heap-
    allocated variables. Advanced chapters later in the course explain how to
    add support for loops, records, arrays, and n-ary functions. 
</div>

<div class="doc">
<a id="lab4"></a><h1 class="section">Multiple Reading Depths</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 All chapters except the first one are organized in three parts.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> The <i>First Pass</i> section presents the most important ideas only.
      The course in designed in such a way that it is possible to read only
      the <i>First Pass</i> section of every chapter. The reader may be interested
      in going through all these sections to get the big picture, before
      revisiting each chapter in more detail.

</li>
<li> The <i>More Details</i> section presents additional material explaining
      in more depth the meaning and the consequences of the key results.
      This section also contains descriptions of the most important proofs.
      By default, readers would eventually read all this material.

</li>
<li> The <i>Optional Material</i> section typically contains the remaining
      proofs, as well as discussions of alternative definitions. The <i>Optional
      Material</i> sections are all independent from each other. These sections
      are intended for (1) readers who plan to continue studying Separation
      Logic beyond the present course, and (2) teachers using the course. 

</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="doc">
<a id="lab5"></a><h1 class="section">Chapters Overview</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The first two chapters, <a href="Basic.html"><span class="inlineref">Basic</span></a> and <a href="Repr.html"><span class="inlineref">Repr</span></a>, give a primer on how
    to prove imperative programs in Separation Logic, i.e. they focus on the end
    user's perspective. The eight following chapters focus on the implementor's
    perspective, explaining how Separation Logic is defined and how a practical
    verification tool can be constructed. The last three chapters cover language
    extensions, from the perspective of both the user and the implementor.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The list of chapters appears below. The numbering corresponds to <i>teaching
    units</i>: if the chapters were taught as part of a University course, one
    could reasonably aim to cover one teaching unit per week.

<li> All other <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">Lib</span>*</span> files are imports from the TLC library, which is

</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The TLC library is a collection of general purpose theory and tactics
    developed over the years by Arthur Charguéraud. The TLC library is exploited
    in this course to streamline the presentation. TLC provides, in particular,
    extensions for classical logic and tactics that are particularly well suited
    for meta-theory. Prior knowledge of TLC is not required, and all exercises
    can be completed without using TLC tactics.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The classical logic aspects of TLC are presented in chapter <a href="Hprop.html"><span class="inlineref">Hprop</span></a>.
    Each TLC tactic is introduced when it is first used. Most of these tactics
    are also presented in the chapter <a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/UseTactics.html"><span class="inlineref">UseTactics</span></a> of Software
    Foundations Volume 2 (<i>Programming Language Foundations</i>).
