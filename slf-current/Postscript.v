(** * Beyond the Scope of This Course *)

(** This course has focused on the foundations of Separation Logic for
    sequential programs, and discussed the set up of tooling for computing
    weakest preconditions.

    There are numerous aspects of Separation Logic that were not covered in this
    course, including:

    - Concurrent Separation Logic, for reasoning about concurrent programs.
    - Automated reasoning using Separation Logic, typically for a restricted
      fragment of Separation Logic.
    - Separation Logic for low-level programs, at the byte level, and with
      assembly-style code written in continuation-passing style.
    - Separation Logic for object-oriented programs.
    - Reasoning about I/O, integer overflows, floatting-point arithmetics,
      etc. *)

(** * Tools Leveraging Separation Logic *)

(** Ideas of Separation Logic have had significant influence on the field of
    programming languages from various perspectives. For a broad survey of
    Separation Logic, we refer to Peter O'Hearn's CACM paper [2019].
    https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3211968 (Make sure to also download the
    "supplementary material" link at the bottom of the page.)

    Here is a non-exhaustive list of active projects leveraging Separation
    Logic.

    - The tool "Infer" leverages for static analysis, that is, fully automated
      program analysis to produce a list of potential bugs.
      https://fbinfer.com/
      https://fbinfer.com/docs/separation-logic-and-bi-abduction/

    - The programming language "Rust" features a type system with "borrows", a
      notion directly inspired by Separation Logic.

    - The tool "VeriFast" targets C and Java programs.
      https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bart.jacobs/verifast and
      https://github.com/verifast/verifast

    - The tool "Verifiable C" tool, from the VST project, targets the
      verification of C code, using interactive Coq proofs based on Separation
      Logic.
      https://vst.cs.princeton.edu/
      See also volume 5 of Software Foundations.

    - The tool "Viper" is based on a variant of Separation Logic, its front-end
      supports several languages, and its backend leverages the SMT solver Z3;
      it also supports user annotations in the code for guiding proofs.
      https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper.html

    - The "Isabelle Refinement Framework" leverages Separation Logic is the
      process of refining monadic high-order logic definitions into efficient
      imperative code. It can be used to produce verified ML code, as well as
      LLVM IR code.
      https://www21.in.tum.de/~lammich/pub/itp15_sepref.pdf

    - The tool "CFML" targets the verification of OCaml programs. The original
      version of CFML leverages a version of characteristic formulae slightly
      more complicated than the one presented in this volume. The new version,
      CFML 2.0, directly leverages all the ideas from this course, in particular
      the weakest-precondition style [wpgen] function.

    - The verified compiler "CakeML" implements technology similar to that
      of CFML, and leverages it to verify components from its standard library
      and from its runtime.

    - The Iris project develops advanced logics for reasoning about concurrent
      programs using Separation Logic. *)
